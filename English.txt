From Adam to Seth , from Seth to Enosh , Enosh to Kenan , Kenan to Mahalalel to my father , Methuselah , then to me . Today , that birthright passes to you , Noah . My son . The Creator made Adam in His image , and then placed the world in his care . This is your work now . Your responsibility . May you walk alongside The Creator in righteousness . So I say to you ... The Shrine of Seth ! Men . Hide . We mine here . The ground is rich with tzohar . This is The Creator 's land . What are you doing ? The Creator ? My mines run dry . My city withers and must be fed . And what has He done ? He cursed us to struggle by the sweat of our brow to survive ! Damned if I do n't do everything it takes to do just that . Damned if I do n't take what I want . This relic belongs to the descendants of Cain now . The line of Seth ends here . It is ours . Now dig ! Ham . What are you doing ? It 's pretty - You see those other flowers ? How they 're attached to the ground ? That 's where they should be . They have a purpose . They sprout . And they bloom . The wind takes their seeds and more flowers grow . We only collect what we can use , and what we need . Do you understand ? Shem . Ham . Let 's go . Men . Hide , hide . Go . You found our kill . How fortunate . But for you ... maybe not . You know how long it is since we ate meat ? Since we even saw an animal ? Easy . Please . What do you want ? Justice . Why did they kill it ? They eat them . Why ? They think it makes them stronger . Is it true ? They forget strength comes from The Creator . Mama ! Mommy ! See your brothers ? Ham saw men hunting today . They are getting closer . How was he ? A little too interested . Hmm . He had to see it sometime . I saw something else . A flower bloom from nothing . Rest . Perhaps He will finally make things right . Methuselah . Did He speak to you ? I think so . Will He help us ? He 's going to destroy the world . It 's a long and dangerous journey for the boys . How do you know your grandfathers still alive ? I do n't . I saw his mountain . We need to go and find out if he knows what we 're to do . Shem . Can you help me with this ? We could take the boys and find a place to hide . There 'll be no hiding . We should have left already . Ham , let me show you how to do that . Push it in here . Next time we come through , we 'll know we 've got certain things we might need . There are cities ahead . We will not get too close . Is that a tzohar mine ? It was once . Before they dug it all up . Should we go around ? No . Do you think they 're all dead ? It looks that way . They must have been scavenging here . And someone scavenged from them . Dada ! Stay close . Father ! Here ! May I see ? Let me see . Tell me your name . You have a name ? Ila . My name is Ila . Ila . You 're going to be all right , Ila . This is Shem . He 's going to hold your hand tight and he wo n't let go . Up the hill ! Hurry ! Hurry ! We have to go . Now . Up the hill . Run . We ca n't go there . We have no choice . Hurry ! Hold , men ! Hold ! The giants ! They 'll kill you ! Shem ! Protect your mother , first and last . I love you . Run ! Noah ! Noah ! Noah . Noah . Are you all right ? We are to see Methuselah . My grandfather . A child of the old one ? You should have killed them . But , Samyaza ... This is a man , Og . Do you forget how they betrayed The Creator ? It is He who sends us ! It lies ! Leave them here to rot . What are they ? The Watchers . Dada ? Sleep now . Sing to me . I want my daddy to sing to me . You know , I , too , lost my father when I was very young . There 's a song he used to sing me sometimes when I could n't sleep . Would you like to hear it ? The moon is high . The trees entwine . Your father waits for thee . To wrap you in His sheltering wings . And whisper you to sleep . Your Father is . The healing wind . That whispers you to sleep . That whispers as you sleep . It 's an ugly wound . She 'll never have children . If the fever does n't take her , I think she 'll live . Follow me . I 'm sorry I frightened you . Watchers have learned to fear men . Then why are you helping us ? The Creator formed us on the second day . The day He made the heavens . We watched over Adam and Eve . Saw their frailty and their love . And then we saw their fall . And we pitied them . We were not stone then , but Light . It was not our piece to interfere . Yet we chose to try and help mankind . And when we disobeyed The Creator , He punished us . We were encrusted by your world . Rock and mud shackled our fiery glow . Still , we taught mankind all we knew of Creation . With our help they rose from the dust , became great and mighty . But then they turned our gifts to violence . Only one man protected us . Your grandfather Methuselah . We were hunted . Most of us killed . Those who lived were left prisoners in these stony shells , marooned upon this barren land . We begged The Creator to take us home . But He was always silent . And now you claim that you have heard His call . Samyaza cannot accept this . A man ? When it is men who broke the world . But I look at you and I see a glimmer of Adam again . The man I knew . The man I came to help . Why ca n't I come ? Because I need you to look after Mother . Do you understand ? And you look after your father . Watch over them . They are in good hands . Grandfather ? Noah . This is your great-grandfather . Show him respect . Tell him your name . I am Shem . My eldest . Come closer . Let me see you . You 're a lucky boy . I think you must have your mothers looks , not your father 's . Come tell me about yourself . So , what do you like most in the world ? Berries . What ? Berries . Ah , berries , yes . What can compete with fresh , ripe berries ? Nothing . Yes , it 's been so long I can barely remember the taste of them . Ah , tell me , did you bring me any ? No ? Oh . I 'm craving them now . Ah , well , perhaps one day . You must be tired . It 's a long way up here . Yeah . Why not rest ? How perfect . What we need to discuss is not for boys . You know why I 've come ? Yes . Before he walked on , my father Enoch told me that one day , if man continued in his ways , The Creator would annihilate this world . So what I saw is true ? All life blotted out because of what man has done ? Can it not be averted ? Noah , you must trust that He speaks in a way that you can understand . So you tell me . Can this destruction be averted ? No . Oh . He sent me here . Why send me if there 's nothing I can do to stop it ? Well , perhaps He simply sends you here to share a cup of tea with an old man . So , is that all you saw ' ? The fires of destruction on this place ? No , not fire . Water . Water ? Huh . My father said it would be fire . I saw water . Death by water . I saw death . And I saw new life . There 's something more , Grandfather . Something I 'm to do . I know it . I just did n't see what it was . New life . Well , perhaps there is more for you to see . Did He not send you here to drink a cup of tea with an old man ? The medicine always tastes bad . She was the only one moving . Was she hurt badly ? She had a big cut on her belly . Mother helped and I held her hand . That must have made her feel safe . Well ? Fire consumes all . Water cleanses . It separates the foul from the pure . The wicked from the innocent . And that which sinks from that which rises . He destroys all , but only to start again . You sure ? Yes . The storm cannot be stopped . But it can be survived . Yeah . You may need this . It 's a seed . From the first Garden . From Eden . Remember , Noah , He chose you for a reason . Oh ... You ca n't get me ! Oh , you ca n't get me ! Dada ! My grandfather lives . He 's helped me see what we 're here to do . Men are going to be punished for what they 've done to this world . There will be destruction . There will be tragedy . And our family has been chosen for a great task . We 've been chosen to save the innocent . The innocent ? The animals . Why are they innocent ? Because they still live as they did in the Garden . Yes . And we need to save enough of them to start again . But what of us ? I guess we get to start again , too . We get to start again in a new and better world . But first we have to build . Build what ? A great flood is coming . The waters of the heavens will meet the waters of the earth . We build a vessel to survive the storm . We build an ark . Take the traitor back . He is a child of the old one ! Stop ! There is work to do . Help us . Help you ? We tried to help your kind once . And we lost everything because of you ! Not everything . We can save what is left . We can serve Him again . You treacherous snake ! The Creator . Children ! What is this ? This ... This is our ark . We will help this man . No ! Shem . Wait . Please . It still hurts ? Ham ! Shem ! He does n't have anyone . Come . Father , did you see them ? Father ? Yes , Japheth . It begins . Ready ? It sleeps . Gently . See , that 's a boy one and that 's a girl one . After the storm , they 'll become a mother and a father . And the hatchlings will spread right across the world . We have to be gentle with them and we have to be protective . If something were to happen , that would be a small piece of Creation lost forever . All of these innocent creatures are now in our care . It 's our job to look after them . Father ? All the birds are two . You have Mother , Shem has Ila . But what of me ? What of Japheth ? Who is there for us ? Did you see how He made the forest to give us wood for the ark ? How He sent the birds ? So , has n't He sent everything we need ? Mother ! What is it ? What ? Snakes ! Snakes are coming , too ? Yeah . All that creeps , all that crawls , all that slithers . It 's all right . Father ! Father ! Do n't be afraid . No one will hurt this boy . What 's your name ? Ham . Ham ? Oh . I am Tubal-cam . Do you know me ? You do n't know your king ? My father says there can be no king in The Creator 's garden . Hmm . Ham , come here . Do not take my best soldier . He 's nothing of yours . Look at his hand on that weapon . I believe he is something of mine . Ham . Leave it . No , he gave it to me . Do what I tell you . When I heard talk of miracles , I dismissed them . But then I saw the birds with my own eyes , flying here , and I had to come . There is n't anything for you here . No ? This all belongs to me . This land . This forest . That stronghold of yours . Did you really think you could protect yourself from me in that ? It 's not protection from you . Then what is it ? An ark to hold the innocent when The Creator sends his deluge to wipe out the wicked from this world . The Creator does not care what happens in this world . Nobody has heard from Him since He marked Cain . We are alone . Orphaned children , cursed to struggle by the sweat of our brow to survive . Damned if I do n't do everything it takes to do just that . Damned if I do n't take what I want . We have met ? I am the son of Lamech ! Eight generations descended from Seth ! Return to your cities of Cain ! Know we have all been judged ! I have men at my back , and you stand alone and defy me ? I 'm not alone . Take the children ! Do not fear , my people ! Do n't be afraid ! Stand ! Hold your line , men . His minions , uh , they 're with you ? Hmm . Miracles ? A deluge , you claim ? Well , perhaps you 're right . Perhaps casting us out of Paradise was not enough . Perhaps , He returns to finish us off . Well , if He does , I will ride the storm in that ship of yours . There is no escape for you and your kind . Your time is done . The land is dying . Ham . The cities are dead . Do n't listen to him . My people follow me ! And more will follow them ! I 'm not afraid of miracles , son of Lamech ! If you refuse my dozens now , I shall return with legions ! Move . Father ? Will so many really come ? We need to finish as fast as we can . The sooner He sends the rain , the better . Until then , we 're safer inside . We build . First weapons , then men . Feed only those that will fight . Arm them , train them , and there is nothing they ca n't do . With an army , we can crush those giants . Please , we 're hungry ! Give us meat . Our children are starving . Please help us ! Let us go ! We 're starving ! Should I come back ? No . Do you think those men are going to attack us ? When the rain comes . What do you think it 'll be like ? I 've imagined it . Seeing that much death , I 'm not sure there are words . The end of everything . The beginning . The beginning of everything . So what is it ? Whatever he 's done or said , Shem is very fond of you . Shem needs a woman . A real woman . He should have a family . I ca n't give any of that to him . And I 'm not going to deny him those things , even if he wants me to . I wo n't do it . Besides , why would The Creator want a barren girl on His ark ? Ila . Ila . When we first took you in , I thought you were going to be a burden . And I did n't want to see anybody else ruined by this world . But I was wrong . You 're a gift . A precious , precious gift . Just do n't forget how precious a gift you are . I know you 'll be going to find wives for Ham and Japheth . You should find one for Shem , too . Ila . Where do you think you 're going ? Please , please do n't take my baby ! Let them go ! Please ! Sorry , we have to eat ! Do n't take my baby ! No ! Do n't take my baby ! No , no , please will you stop him ? Let them go ! No ! Quit struggling ! It 'll be easier . Come with me ! Stop struggling ! You ! You ! I have two girls ! I have two girls to trade ! Take the girls ! Give me the meat ! Give it to me ! What happened ? All of this should be inside by now . The storm is coming . What about our wives ? Where are they ? Did you not hear what I just said ? But when are they coming ? There will be no wives . What ? What ? No ! You said that The Creator would give us what we 'll need . Help your brother . No . Listen , you ca n't do this ! You ca n't . How am I supposed to be a man ? I said help your brother . You want me to stay a child ! No ! I 'm asking you to be a man and do what needs to be done . Ham ! Ham ! What are you doing , Noah ? The wickedness is not just in them . It 's in all of us . I saw it . No . Noah . There 's goodness in us . Look at our boys . Shem 's loyalty . Japheth 's kindness . Ham 's integrity . Hmm ? Good men . They 'd be good fathers . Shem is blinded by desire . Ham is covetous . And Japheth lives only to please . I am no better . And you ? Is there anything you would not do , good or bad , for those three boys ? We would both choose to kill in order to protect our children . Yes . We 're no different . We were weak and we were selfish to think we could set ourselves apart . We will work , complete the task , and then we 'll die . The same as everyone else . They are children ! They are our children , Noah ! Have you no mercy ? The time for mercy has passed . Now our punishment begins . Ham ! Ham ! Grandfather ? Grandfather ? Did you bring me something ? Did Noah plant the seed I gave him ? Yes . Mmm . And in all that forest there were no berries ? Shem promised me berries . On . I 'm sorry . I did n't know . Huh . It 's a pity . Then why did you come here ? It 's Noah . He leaves our boys with no one . Shem has Ila , but she 's barren . There 'll be no other wives , so no children . Justice . The Creator destroys this world because we corrupted it . So we ourselves must be destroyed . No . I ca n't believe that 's true . Not when I look at my sons . All they desire is love . Is n't that all their hearts need to be good ? Who is good ? Who is wicked ? How am I supposed to know what is right ? That choice is Noah 's . Not mine . Not yours . It sounds like he has made it . So then you will not help me ? I do n't know if I even could . But if I tried , it could cause pain and possibly tragedy . And in the end , it would just come back to Noah again . Is that what you wish ? I want my sons to have children . I want them to be happy . I ca n't bear to think of them dying alone . Out of the way ! Coming through ! Whoa ! Please ! Get away ! No . No , no ... It 's all right . It 's all right . I 'm not ... I 'm not going to hurt you . I have food . Here . What do you want ? Nothing . Are you alone ? Yes . And you ? I can help you to get away . No . Well , then , I 'll slay a little while . If that is all right ? My name is Na 'El . Shem ! Go and find them and bring them back . Be careful . Ham ? Do n't be afraid , granddaughter . Do n't be afraid . Grandfather ? Yes . What are you doing down here ? I 'm looking for berries . I have a craving . Come and help me look for them . My eyes are n't as good as they used to be . I have to find Ham . There 's time enough for that . Come here . Come . Come here and help me . They 're here somewhere . They 're here somewhere , berries . I know there are berries . There 's nothing here , Grandfather . Let me take you to Noah . No . No need for that . You go now . You go . Oh , wait . Wait . Ten years you 've been with my own . With my own family . Ten years . And you love them ? Shem ? And Noah ? He saved my life . Raised me . Yes , he did . Yes . And you are now as his own daughter . My own great-granddaughter . Ten years in the shadow of my home , and yet I have never given you my blessing . May I ? Ham ! Ila ! You can go now . Go to him . You go . Go now . Ila ! Ila ! Ila ! We have to get back ... We have to go . We have to go . Come on . Now ! I am a man . Made in Your image . Why will You not converse with me ? I give life . I take life away . As You do ! And I am like You , am I not ? Speak to me . Speak to me ! It has begun ! Death comes from the heavens ! This rain is meant to wash us off the face of this world . But we are men . We decide if we live or die . We are men ! And men united are invincible ! Do you want to live ? Yeah ! We kill the giants ! We kill Noah ! We take the ark ! Yeah ! Noah ! Where 's Ham ? Get it off me , no ! Ow ! No , no , no ! We have to get away ! I wo n't leave you . I wo n't ! Ham ! Father , help ! Help ! Help her ! Help me , please ! Please , help me , please ! Please ... Someone please help me ! Help me ! No ! Ham ! Ham ! Ham ! Ham ! Ham ! Ham ! Ham ! Samyaza ! Samyaza ! Samyaza ! Noah ! Where is Ham ? Ham is through ! Quickly ! Run ! Ham . Ham ! Faster ! Forward ! Protect your mother . Protect them all . Part ! My Creator , forgive me . The Creator brings him home . Ham ? Ham ? Shem . Shem , go inside . Go inside . They are upon us . Go inside ! Good-bye , son of Adam . Son , where are you ? Ham ! Ham ? Ham ? It 's all right . Shem ! Father ! Japheth , where are you ? Ila , I 'm here ! Father ! Mother , where 's Father ? Please , Noah , there must be something we can do . We can drag ropes . They cannot all be soldiers , Father . They are just people . And there 's room . There is no room for them . Soon everything we knew will be gone . All that is left of Creation will lie within these walls . Outside , just the waters of chaos again . You are angry . You judge me . Let me tell you a story . The first story my father told me , and the first story that I told each of you . In the beginning , there was nothing . Nothing but the silence of an infinite darkness . But the breath of The Creator fluttered against the ace of the void , whispering , Let there be light ! And light was . And it was good . The first day . And then the formless light began to take on substance and shape . A second day . And our world was born . Our beautiful , fragile home . And a great , warming light nurtured its days . And a lesser light ruled the nights . And there was evening . And morning . Another day . And the waters of the world gathered together , and in their midst emerged dry land . Another day passed . And the ground put forth the growing things . A thick blanket of green sketching across all Creation . And the waters , too , teamed with life . Great creatures of the deep that are no more . Vast multitudes of fish , some of which may still swim beneath these seas . And soon the sky was streaming with birds . And there was evening . And there was morning . A fifth day . Now the whole world was full of living beings . Everything that creeps , everything that crawls , and every beast that walks upon the ground . And it was good . It was all good . There was light and air and water and soil , all clean and unspoiled . There were plants and fish and fowl and beast , each after their own kind . All part of the greater whole . All in their place . And all was in balance . It was paradise . A Jewel in The Creator 's palm . Then The Creator made Man . And by his side , Woman . Father and mother of us all . He gave them a choice . Follow the temptation of darkness or hold on to the blessing of light . But they ate from the forbidden fruit . Their innocence was extinguished . And so for the ten generations since Adam , sin has walked within us . Brother against brother . Nation against nation . Man against Creation . We murdered each other . We broke the world . We did this . Man did this . Everything that was beautiful , everything that was good , we shattered . Now , it begins again . Air , water , earth , plant , fish , bird and beast . Paradise returns . But this time , this time there will be no men . If we were to enter the Garden again , it would only be to destroy it once more . No . The Creator has judged us . Mankind must end . Shem and Ila , you will bury your mother and I . Ham , you will bury them . Japheth will lay you to rest . You , Japheth , you will be the last man . And in time you , too , will return to the dust . Creation will be left alone , safe and beautiful . I 'm very sorry about that girl . And I 'm sorry for you . But we have been entrusted with a task much greater than our own desires . Ham . Shh . Noah ... Does he know I 'm here ? Does he know I 'm here ? No , no , no . No . Why are you helping me ? There was a girl . I tried to bring her . But he just let her die . Ah . And now you want revenge . No . Yes , you do . Yes , you do . There 's no more land . Everything out there must be dead . It had to be what He wanted . A world without man . You see that , do n't you ? What I see is how hard this was for you to do as a man who respects life , a man who loves his children . You 've been strong . But it 's done . It 's done now . And you can put that burden down . Noah . It 's all right . If your father found me , he would kill me . We must be ready , but I am too weak . Mmm . What are you doing ? I must get my strength back . The beasts are precious . There are only two of each . And there is only one of me . But the rain , all these miracles , are for them . Them ? Your father fills a ship with beasts while children drown . He belittles you by telling you you must serve them . Oh , no . They serve us . That is the greatness of men . When The Creator finished making the sky , the ground , the sea , and this beast , He was n't satisfied . He needed something greater . Something to take dominion over it and subdue it . Mmm . So He made us in His image . Us . This is your world , Ham . Seize it . Ila . Oh , Grandfather . What is it ? You 're not sick . But that 's impossible . What ? What is it ? Noah . It is his grandchild . What 's wrong ? Father . Noah . We 've come to ask for your blessing . I do n't understand . I am with Child . It 's not possible . You 're barren . You ca n't conceive . How ... How is that possible ? Grandfather . I asked Grandfather ... To what ? Undermine The Creator ? To give our children a future . To give humanity a future . Have you any idea what you 've done ? All those lives ! All those people ! For nothing ! Do you know what this forces me to do ? No ! Please ! Please ! Please ! I cannot do this ! Tell me I do n't need to do this ! Please . Have I not done everything that You asked of me ? Is that not enough ? Why do You not answer me ? Why ? I will not fail You . I will not fail You . I will not fail You . It shall be done . It shall be done . Father ? The rains have stopped . The Creator smiles on our child . The rains have stopped because of your child , yes , but He does not smile . If your child is a boy , he will replace Japheth , last man . If it is a girl , who could mature into a mother , she must die . Are you mad ? That is my child ! If you should bear a girl , in the moment of her birth , I will cut her down . Mother ! Mother , my bird ! Nothing . No mud . Nothing . We still have to go . Ila , there 's nothing . There 's nothing out there . You have food and water for how long ? Weeks ? A month ? A month . Please wait . Wail until the bird finds land . Please . Japheth , send him again . He 's too tired . Then wake another . Here . Please . One that can find us a home . No . We leave today . They will die out there . Not if they stay . And let you kill their child ? Noah . Noah ! I did this . I did this , Noah ! Please ! Punish me ! Punish me , Noah ! Not them . Not the child . Please . The child is not being punished . We are all being punished . All of us . It 's not something I want to do . It 's something I have to do . It is painful , but it is just . Just ? How ? How is this just ? It 's a baby , Noah . If you hold to this , you will lose your sons , you will lose Ila , you will lose me . I love you , Noah . And I have followed you everywhere . Through everything . I forgave you . When everyone was dead , I forgave you . I was ready to die with you . But this I will never forgive . Boy or girl , I will never forgive ! And you will die alone ! Not just alone , but hated ! Hated by everyone you love ! That is just ! That is just . Oh ... Oh . It 's time . Bring him through there . One blow will finish it . Just in case , huh ? I do n't know if I can . He killed your woman . And now he plots to kill your brothers firstborn . Is that what you want ? You want your sister to die on the seas ? A man is n't ruled by the heavens . A man is ruled by his will . So I ask you , are you a man ? Good . Because if you 're a man , you can kill . But he wo n't follow me . Thank you , Japheth . You take care of that baby . Do n't be afraid , Mother . We 'll see each other in the new world . Father . No ! No ! How could you ? I thought you were good ! I thought that 's why He chose you . He chose me because He knew I would complete the task , nothing more , son . Mother . Mother . It 's your time . Come . Come with me . You 're all right . Japheth , stand back . Come now . Come inside . That 's right . That 's right . Shh . You 're all right , Ila . You 're safe here . Please keep it inside . Your baby 's coming . Your baby 's coming , Ila . Do n't think about anything else . Father ! Father , they 're awake ! They 're awake ! They 're eating each other ! The beasts . What ? Come . Come ! It 's not possible for them to have woken up without our help . Which way , son ? That 's right . That 's right . The line of Cain . I told you , I 'm not afraid of miracles . That 's right . That 's right . A bit more . Boy or girl ? What 's happening ? There 's another . Two ? Twins . Mother , so ? I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . Sisters . No . No ! No ! No ! He will not touch our daughters . No ! Shem ! Shem ! I should have killed you when I killed your father . Well , now we finish it . Now ! The evils of mankind will not live in this new Eden . Leave us ! Leave us alone ! He 's mine ! The ark , the beasts , and all of your women are now mine . I will build a new world in my image ! Now you are a man . The Creator has not forgotten us . Her name was Na 'El . She was innocent . She was good . It 's a boy . It 's a boy . It 's a boy . Move away . It 's a boy . Where is she ? Where is she ? No . No . No . You ca n't . They 're beautiful . They ? You ca n't kill two . He sent us what we need . Oh , no . No . No ! You ca n't ! No ! Noah ! Ila ! Noah . Please . These are my children ! Your grandchildren ! I will not be stopped . I know I cannot stop you , but they 're crying ! Please do n't let them die crying . Let me calm them . Please , just let them be at peace . The moon is high . The leaves entwine . Your father waits for thee . To wrap you in His sheltering wings . To whisper you to sleep . To wrap you in . His welcoming arms . Till the night sky breaks . Your Father is the healing wind . That whispers you to sleep . That whispers us . to sleep . You do not need to see this . I will hold them . Do it quickly . Do it quickly ! I cannot do this . It 's all right . Hide your eyes , Japheth . Ham ? He 's here . You do n't have to go . I do n't belong here . For what it 's worth , I 'm glad that it begins again with you . Maybe we 'll learn to be kind . Will he come back ? Some things cannot be unbroken . I have to know ... Why did you spare them ? I looked down at those two little girls , and all I had in my heart was love . Then why are you alone , Noah ? Why are you separated from your family ? Because I failed Him . And I failed all of you . Did you ? He chose you for a reason , Noah . He showed you the wickedness of man and knew you would not look away . But then you saw goodness , too . The choice was put in your hands because He put it there . He asked you to decide if we were worth saving . And you chose mercy . You chose love . He has given us a second chance . Be a father . Be a grandfather . Help us to do better this time . Help us start again . The Creator made Adam in His image , and placed the world in his care . That birthright was passed down to us . To my father , then to me , and to my sons , Shem , Japheth , and Ham . That birthright is now passed to you , our grandchildren . This will be your work , and your responsibility . So I say to you , be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth . Are you paying attention ? Good . If you 're not listening carefully , you will miss things , important things . I will not pause . I will not repeat myself , and you will not interrupt me . You think that because you are sitting where you are and I am sitting where I am that you are in control of what is about to happen . You 're mistaken . I am in control . Because I know things that you do not know . Manchester Police Department , please hold . Windows broken . Home 's been ransacked . Send a detective down , will you ? What I will need from you now is a commitment . You will listen closely , and you will not judge me until I am finished . If you cannot commit to this , then please leave the room . Come in . But if you choose to stay , remember you chose to be here . What happens from this moment forwards is not my responsibility . It 's yours . Pay attention . - What 's all this , then ? - Turing , Alan . Professor at King 's . - Seems there 's been a burglary . - Oh ? What of ? Well , that 's just it . Nothing missing , really . What 's he doing in Manchester ? Something with machines . The project at the NPL . I checked , but he won 't say what it 's on . Professor Turing ? Detective Nock , Manchester Police . Sergeant Staehl here tells me you had a burglary last night . Professor Turing ? Take a step back , and don 't breath heavily . - Breathe ? - Undiluted cyanide . It wouldn 't take more than a thimbleful to kill you . - Disappointing . - Pardon ? I had hoped for a bit more . Sergeant Staehl , is it just me , or do you get the sense that we 're being insulted ? Last night , you had a break- in . Your neighbor , Mr . Springborn , called to report the noise . He said there was quite a ruckus . Only you say nothing was taken . It 's odd . So , how about you tell us what happened , and we 'll find the chap who did this . Gentlemen , I don 't believe that you could find the chap that did this if he walked up to you and spat in your face . What I could us right now is not a bobby , but a really good cleaning lady . So , unless one of you has an apron in your car , I suggest you file your reports and leave me alone . As you say , Professor Turing . Best of luck with your cyanide . I' ll give you a quid if you can name me a more insufferable sod . - Seemed a bit forced , though , didn 't it ? - Don 't know what you mean . Well , if you didn 't want a pair of bobbies digging around in your personal affairs , that 'd have been a stellar way to make sure they don 't . Tell me you don 't think this is suspicious . I don 't think this is suspicious . A mysterious professor who won 't admit he 's had something stolen from his house ? I think Alan Turing 's hiding something . War declared ! 800, 000 children evacuated ! German bombs on their way ! Get your papers here ! Fresh off the press ! War declared ! 800, 000 children evacuated ! German bombs expected soon ! This morning , the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German government a final note stating that unless we heard from them , by 11 : 00 , a state of war would exist between us . I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received . And that , consequently , this country is at war with Germany . For the second time in the lives of most of us , we are ... at war . To find a peaceful way out ... Papers , please . What are you doing here ? - Oh , the lady told me to wait . - In my office ? She tell you to help yourself to tea while you were here ? No , she didn 't . She obviously didn 't tell you what a joke was , then , either , I gather . Was she supposed to ? - Who are you ? - Alan Turing . Turing . The mathematician . - Correct . - However could I have guessed ? Well , you didn 't . You just read it on that piece of paper . King 's College , Cambridge . Now , it says here you were a bit of a prodigy in the maths department . I 'm not sure I can evaluate that , Mr .... - How old are you , Mr . Turing ? - 27 . And how old were you when you became a Fellow at Cambridge ? - 24 . - And how old were you ... when you published this paper that has a title I can barely understand ? 23 . And you don 't think that qualifies you as a certified prodigy ? Well , Newton discovered binomial theorem aged 22 . Einstein wrote four papers that changed the world by the age of 26 . As far as I can tell , I' ve ... I' ve barely made par . - My God , you 're serious . - Would you prefer I made a joke ? Oh , I don 't think you know what those are . Hardly seems fair that that 's a requirement for employment here , Mr ... Commander Denniston , Royal Navy . All right , Mr . Turing , I' ll bite . Why do you wish to work for His Majesty 's government ? Oh , I don 't , really . Are you a bleeding pacifist ? I 'm ... agnostic about violence . Well , you do realize that 600 miles away from London there 's this nasty little chap called Hitler who wants to engulf Europe in tyranny ? Politics isn 't really my area of expertise . Really ? Well , I believe you 've just set the record for the shortest job interview in British military history . Mother says I can be off- putting sometimes on account of being one of the best mathematicians in the world . - In the world ? - Oh , yes . Do you know how many people I' ve rejected for this program ? No . Well , that 's right , because we 're a top- secret program . But I' ll tell you , just because we 're friends , that only last week , I rejected one of our great nation 's top linguists . Knows German better than Bertolt Brecht . - I don 't speak German . - What ? I don 't ... speak German . Well , how the hell were you supposed to decrypt German communications if you don 't ... I don 't know , speak German ? Well , I 'm really quite excellent at crossword puzzles . Margaret ! The German codes are a puzzle . A game , just like any other game . - Margaret , where are you ? - I 'm really very good at games . Puzzles . And this is the most difficult puzzle in the world . Margaret ! For the love of God . This is a joke , obviously . I 'm afraid I don 't know what those are , Commander Denniston . Have a pleasant trip back to Cambridge , Professor . Enigma . You called for me ? That 's what you 're doing here . The top- secret program at Bletchley . You 're trying to break the German Enigma machine . What makes you think that ? It 's the greatest encryption device in history , and the Germans use it for all major communications . If the Allies broke Enigma , well ... this would turn into a very short war , indeed . Of course that 's what you 're working on . But you also haven 't got anywhere with it . If you had , you wouldn 't be hiring cryptographers out of university . You need me a lot more than I need you . I like solving problems , Commander . And Enigma is the most difficult problem in the world . No , Enigma isn 't difficult ; it 's impossible . The Americans , the Russians , the French , the Germans , everyone thinks Enigma is unbreakable . Good . Let me try , and we 'll know for sure , won 't we ? Welcome to Enigma . The details of every surprise attack , every secret convoy and every U- boat in the bloody Atlantic go into that thing . And out comes gibberish . It 's beautiful . It 's the crooked hand of death itself . Our Wrens intercept thousands of radio messages a day , and to the lovely young ladies of the Women 's Royal Navy , they 're nonsense . It 's only when you feed them back into Enigma that they make any sense . But we have an Enigma machine . Yes , Polish Intelligence smuggled it out of Berlin . So , what 's the problem ? Just put the intercepted messages - back into the Enigma and you 'll ... - Look , it 's not that simple , is it ? Just having an Enigma machine doesn 't help you to decode the messages . Very good , Mr . Turing . To decode a message , you need to know the machine 's settings . Now , the Germans switch settings every day promptly at midnight . We usually intercept our first message around 6 : 00 a . m . , which gives you exactly 18 hours every day to crack the code before it changes , and you start again . Five rotors . Ten plugboard cables . That 's ... - One million ... - A thousand million ... No , no , it 's , I' ve got it . - It 's million , million . - It 's in the millions , obviously . It 's over 150 million million million possible settings . Very good . 159 . If you want to be exact about it . 1- 5- 9 with 18 zeroes behind it . Possibilities . Every single day . Gentlemen , meet Hugh Alexander . I personally selected him to run this unit . Didn 't you ... Mr . Alexander won Britain 's national chess championship . Twice . You 're not the only one who 's good at games around here , Turing . Are we to work together , then ? I prefer to have my own office . You 're a team , and you will work as one . I don 't have time to explain myself as I go along , and ... I 'm afraid these men would only slow me down . If you can 't play together , then I 'm afraid we can 't let you play at all . This is Stewart Menzies , MI6 . There are only five divisions of military intelligence . There is no MI6 . Exactly . That 's the spirit . Mr . Turing , do you know how many British servicemen have died because of Enigma ? - No , I don 't . - Three ... while we 've been having this conversation . Oh , look , there 's another . I rather hope he didn 't have a family . This war Commander Denniston 's been going on about , we 're not winning it . Break the code , at least we have a chance . Shall we leave the children alone with their new toy ? All right , gentlemen ... Let 's play . The game was quite a simple one . Every single German message , every surprise attack , every bombing run , every imminent U- boat assault ... They were all floating through the air . Radio signals that ... well , any schoolboy with an AM kit could intercept . The trick was that they were encrypted . There were 159 million million million possible Enigma settings . All we had to do was try each one . But if we had ten men checking one setting a minute for 24 hours every day and seven days every week , how many days do you think it would take to ... to check each of the settings ? Well , it 's not days , it 's years . - Good morning . - It 's 20 million years . - To stop a coming attack ... - Thank you . ... we would have to check 20 million years´ worth of settings in 20 minutes . I 'm famished . Lunch ? Good Lord . What is it about women with little hats ? The boys , we 're going to get some lunch . - Alan ? - Yes ? I said we 're going to get some lunch . - Alan ? - Yes ? - Can you hear me ? - Yes . I said we 're off to get some lu ... This is starting to get a little bit repetitive . What is ? I had asked if you wanted to come to lunch with us . No , you didn 't . You said you were going to get some lunch . - Have I offended you in some way ? - Why would you think that ? - Would you like to come to lunch with us ? - What time 's lunchtime ? Christ , Alan , it 's a bleeding sandwich . - What is ? - Lunch . - Oh , I don 't like sandwiches . - Never mind . You know , to pull off this irascible genius routine , one actually has to be a genius , Alan . And yet we 're the ones making progress here , aren 't we ? Oh , you are ? Yes , we are . We have decrypted a number of German messages by analyzing the frequency of letter distribution . Oh , even a broken clock is right twice a day . That 's not progress ; that 's just blind luck . I 'm designing a machine that will allow us to break every message every day instantly . Who 's hungry ? Let 's go . I 'm hungry . What ? Peter asked who was hungry . Can I have some soup , please ? What do you mean , " classified " ? No , I 'm aware of the literal meaning of the word classified . What I 'm asking is why would a maths professor have his military records classified ? Yeah , well , I will come down . Sorry , can I get you to hold for a minute , please ? Pardon me , I 'd like to see some documents , if I may . Service records of a Mr . Turing . Alan . Foreign Office sent me . This is unacceptable . If you wish to discuss the complaint , I suggest you make a proper appointment . Alexan ... Complaint ? No , no , Hugh Alexander has denied my requisition for parts and equipment that I need to build the machine I' ve designed . Your fellow code- breakers are refusing to work with you , and they filed a formal complaint . It 's is inspired by an old Polish code machine . - Only this one is infinitely more advanced . - If you don 't respond to the complaint , I shall have to take it up with the Home Office . - Put those files by my desk . - Fine , my response is they 're all idiots . Fire them and use the savings to fund my machine . I only need about 100, 000 pounds . 100, 000 ... Why are you building a machine ? It 's highly technical . You wouldn 't understand . I suggest you make the effort to try . Enigma is ... an extremely well- designed machine . Our problem is that we 're only using men to try to beat it . No , what if only a machine can defeat another machine ? Well , that 's not very technical . Hugh Alexander is in charge of your unit . He said no , and that is that . I simply don 't have time for this . Have you ever won a war , Turing ? I have . Do you know how it 's done ? Order , discipline , chain of command . You 're not at university any longer . You are a very small cog in a very large system . And you will do as your commanding officer instructs . Yes . Who is your commanding officer ? Winston Churchill , Number 10 Downing Street , London , SW1 . You have a problem with my decision , you can take it up with him . Mr . Menzies ! Mr . Menzies ! Are you going to London ? Possibly . Would you deliver a letter for me ? Look , I 'm sorry , but are you joking ? Churchill 's put Alan in charge ? - This is a terrible idea . - No , no , no , no , no . So , I can give these men orders now ? I hate to say it , but yes . Excellent . Keith and Charles , you 're both fired . - Excuse me ? - What ? You 're mediocre linguists , and positively poor code- breakers . Alan , you can 't just fire Keith and Charles . - Well , he just said I could . - No , I did no such thing . But Churchill did . Go to hell . Well , this is inhuman . Even for you . Popular at school , were you ? The problem began , of course , with the carrots . Carrots are orange . And peas are green . They mustn 't touch . I got it . Do you know why people like violence ? It is because it feels ... good . Humans find violence deeply satisfying . But remove the satisfaction , and ... the act becomes ... hollow . Turing ? Come on . Don 't be such a kike about it . Leave him to bloody rot . I didn 't learn this on my own , of course . I had help . Christopher helped . Alan , are you all right ? It 's not my fault . The carrots got in with the peas and ... - I 'm sorry . I won 't let them do it again . - They 're getting worse . They only beat me up because I 'm smarter than they are . No , they beat you up because you 're different . - Mother says I 'm just an odd duck . - And she 's right . But you know , Alan , sometimes it 's the very people who no one imagines anything of who do the things no one can imagine . So , what do we do now ? - We 're short on staff . - Well , we get more staff then . And how do you propose to do that ? - Alan Turing to see Stewart Menzies . - Very good , sir . - So , who are they ? - Oh , all sorts , really . Teacher , an engineer , a handful of students . And you think they 're qualified for Bletchley ' cause they 're good at crossword puzzles ? Well , they say they 're good , and now we shall find out , won 't we ? In order to aid your efforts , there is , to the right of you , a green scratch card book . You are to make notes in that . Gentlemen , you have six minutes in which to complete the puzzle , at which point , I will ... Pardon , ma 'am , this room 's restricted . Apologies for my tardiness . The bus caught a flat tire . May I continue , please ? Thank you . - You 're not allowed in here , ma 'am . - Oh , but I 'm only a few minutes late . The secretaries are to head upstairs . This room 's for the candidates . May I get on with this now , please ? - I am a candidate . - For what position ? - The letter didn 't say precisely . - Yeah , so secretaries are to head upstairs . - It did say that it was top secret . - What is going on ? I solved a crossword puzzle in the newspaper , and I got this letter saying that I was a candidate for some sort of mysterious job . My name 's Joan Clarke . Miss , did you really solve this puzzle yourself ? What makes you think I couldn 't solve the puzzle myself ? - I 'm really very good at ... - Ma 'am , I' ll have to ask you to ... Miss Clarke , I find tardiness under any circumstance , unacceptable . Take a seat so that we may continue . Thank you . Now , as I was saying , you have six minutes to complete the task in front of you . Gentlemen and lady , begin . Six minutes . - Is that even possible ? - No , it takes me eight . This isn 't about crossword puzzles . It 's about how one approaches solving an impossible problem . Do you tackle the whole thing at once or divide it into small ... - You 've finished ? - Yes . - Five minutes and 34 seconds . - You said to do it in under six . Congratulations . My warmest welcome to His Majesty 's service . If you speak a word of what I 'm about to show you , you will be executed for high treason . You will lie to your friends , your family and everyone you meet about what it is you really do . And what is it that we 're really doing ? We 're going to break an unbreakable Nazi code and win the war . What 's that you 're reading ? - It 's about cryptography . - Like secret messages ? Not secret . That 's the brilliant part . Messages that anyone can see , but no one knows what they mean unless you have the key . How 's that different from talking ? - Talking ? - When people talk to each other , they never say what they mean . They say something else , and you 're expected to just know what they mean . Only I never do . So , how 's that different ? Alan , I have a funny feeling you 're going to be very good at this . Good night , Alan . Good night . Hold on , Marion , I 'm coming ! ... lesser settings and then route back through ... Back to those ones ... Careful , will you ? It not a toy . Funny . Looks like a toy . Bloody great 100, 000- pound one . Your new minion 's arrived . - Jack Good . We met ... - Well , where 's Miss Clarke ? Lovely , isn 't he ? It 's not just a usual humdrum production mill factory . I mean , well , as I was saying , it 's a very important radio factory . It 's not , actually . Well , on the spectrum of radio factories , this one is particularly ... Why are you not at Bletchley ? Thank you ... so much for your visit , Mr . Turing . Was your trip pleasant ? Gather your things and let 's go . I 'm sorry , but I 'm unable to accept your offer . We feel that such a position would hardly be appropriate . You earned a double first in mathematics . But sadly wasn 't granted the opportunity to become a Fellow . You belong at Bletchley . I 'm sorry , but for someone in my position , to live to ... to work in a radio factory so far from home , with all your men ... it would be ... indecorous . What in the world does that even mean ? We have a group of young ladies who tend to all of our clerical tasks : assistants , translators . They live together in town . Would that be a more suitable environment ? So , I would be working amongst these women ? Yes . Wonderful ladies . They even organize social events at St . Martin 's Church down the road . Really , the whole thing is quite ... decorous . Now , you won 't have proper security clearance , of course , so , - we 'll have to improvise things a bit . - Why are you helping me ? Because there is only one thing that matters in this entire world right now . Do you understand ? And that is breaking Enigma . But , Mr . Turing ... why are you helping me ? Sometimes it 's the very people who no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine . Sir . - What 's this ? - Alan Turing 's classified military file . - It 's bloody empty . - Exactly . - It 's an empty manila envelope . - Yeah . Well , you 've cracked the case wide open , then , haven 't you ? Alan Turing 's war records aren 't just classified , they 're nonexistent . That means someone 's got rid of them . Erased them . Burned them . And that same person broke into his house and stole nothing ? Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean . - What , the spies from the papers ? - The Soviet spies . But first they were professors , weren 't they ? Radicalized at Cambridge , then they joined the Communist Party , then Foreign Office , then leaked information to Stalin during the war . Now , can you think of anyone else we know who was at Cambridge , then took up something murky and top secret when war broke out ? You think this Alan Turing might be a Soviet agent ? I think something very serious is happening right here under our noses . Wouldn 't you like to find out what it is ? Welcome , ladies . If you 'd like to follow me . Some people thought we were at war with the Germans ... Incorrect . We were at war with the clock . Britain was literally starving to death . The Americans sent over 100, 000 tons of food every week , and every week the Germans would send our desperately needed bread to the bottom of the ocean . Our daily failure was announced at the chimes of midnight . And the sound would haunt our unwelcome dreams . Tick ... tock ... tick . Damn it ! What just happened ? Midnight , all the work we 've done today is useless . Oh , but don 't worry , we 've a few hours before tomorrow 's messages start flooding in ... and we start all over again . - From scratch . - I 'm so sick of this . Four hours rewiring his plugboard matrix . Three hours yesterday on his rotor positions ! - Don 't go over there . - Look , John , no . If this job wasn 't already impossible before , it bloody well is now . Hugh , don 't . Damn you and your useless machine . My machine is how we are going to win . Really ? This machine ? Are you talking about this bloody machine ? ! - Hugh ! Hugh ! Hugh , don 't ! - Hugh ! Hugh ! Stop ! You arrogant bastard . You could help us . You could make this go faster , but you won 't . Get off . He 's right , Alan . There are actual soldiers out there trying to win an actual war . My brother protects food convoys in the Navy . My cousins fly RAF patrols . All my friends , they 're all making a difference , while we just while away our days producing nothing . Because of you . My machine ... will work . Come on , Peter . Okay . Joan ? Will you ... Could you make a bit more noise ? I 'm not quite sure my landlady woke up . - Oh , sorry . - Oh ... look . I think that 's the best I can do . No male visitors after dark . So ... what did you bring me ? - There you go . - Here . Some men try flowers , you know . These are actual decrypted Enigma messages direct from Nazi High Command . " 0600 hours . " Weather today is clear . Rain in the evening . Heil Hitler . " Well , clearly , that vital piece of information is going to win us the war . It 's the relationship between the encrypted and decrypted messages that interests me . Can we find a clue here that we can build into Christopher ? - Who 's Christopher ? - Oh , he 's my machine . You named him ? Is that a bad name ? No . No , never mind . Are you trying to build your universal machine ? - I read your paper at university . - Is it already being taught ? No . No . No , I was precocious . So ... you theorized a machine that could solve any problem . It didn 't just do one thing , it did everything . It wasn 't just programmable , it was reprogrammable . Is that your idea behind Christopher ? Well , human brains can compute large sums very quickly ... even Hugh can do that ... but I want Christopher to be smarter . To make a calculation and then ... to determine what to do next . Like a person does . Think of it . Electrical brain . - A digital computer . - Digital computer . What 's going on ? What 's happening ? - No . No , no . No , no , no ! Don 't touch that ! - Stay back . That 's my desk . Thank goodness . I 'd hate to think we were searching the wrong one . What are you doing ? What 's going on ? There is a spy in Bletchley Park . The Navy thinks that one of us is a Soviet double agent , Alan . Why ? Our boys intercepted this on its way to Moscow . Look familiar ? It 's a Beale cipher . Encrypted with a phrase from a book or a poem or ... You don 't seriously think I did this , do you ? Double agents are such bastards . Isolated loners . No attachments to friends or family . Arrogant . Know anybody like that ? I ... I know you don 't like me , but that does not make me a Soviet spy . Nothing out of the ordinary , sir . Really . All right . The Home Office may be protecting you now , but sooner or later you will make a mistake . And I needn 't bother firing you . They will hang you for treason . Hello . I heard about what happened . It 's all the girls in Hut 3 can talk about . I have an idea of what might cheer you up . So , because no letter can be encoded as itself , there 's already a handful of settings that can be rejected at the outset . - Is that your team ? - Yes . - Shall we say hello ? - No . Hello . I told you not to do that . Alan . - Hugh , hello . - Didn 't know you drank . He doesn 't , really . He just sort of sips at the foam . Well , I' ll let you into a little secret , Miss ... ? - Clarke . - Miss Clarke . - Please . - Foam 's my favorite part , too . - Is it really ? - Come and join us for a drink ? - We 'll be there in a moment . - Miss Clarke . - Well , he likes you . - Yes . You ... got him to like you . - Yes . - Why ? Because I 'm a woman in a man 's job , and I don 't have the luxury of being an ass . Alan ... it doesn 't matter how smart you are , Enigma is always smarter . If you really want to solve your puzzle , then you 're going to need all the help you can get , and they are not going to help you if they do not like you . - What are those ? - Apples . - No . - Oh , they really are . I ... well , Miss Clarke , Joan actually ... said that it would be ... nice if I was to bring you all something . So , here we are . I ... Thank you . I like apples . My best to Miss Clarke . There are two people in a wood , and they run into a bear . The first person gets down on his knees to pray . The second person starts lacing up his boots . The first person asks the second person , " My dear friend , what are you doing ? You can 't outrun a bear . " To which the second person responds , " I don 't have to . I only have to outrun you . " I' ll be with Christopher , if anyone needs me . If we assume that the square root of two is a rational number , then we can say that the square root of two is A over B ... where A and B are whole numbers and B is not zero . - Mr . Turing , passing notes , are we ? - No , sir . Only Turing would pass notes written in gibberish . All right , gentlemen , do not forget your algebra over the break . Have a pleasant holiday , and we 'll resume your irrationals when you return . But Euler 's Theorem gives you that immediately . Here . Look at this . If you run the wires across the plugboard matrix diagonally , it will eliminate rotor positions 500 times faster . That 's ... actually not an entirely terrible idea . I think that was Alan for " thank you . " - That 's my sandwich . - You don 't like sandwiches . You nervous ? What happens now ? It should work out the day 's Enigma settings . How long ? Sieg Heil ! The German Army has fanned out across Europe , from Poland to Serbia , Lithuania to Denmark , Norway to France . The Nazi flag now flies from more than two dozen national capitals . Their campaign mounts in fury as a free Europe crumbles . Oh , it 's still going . - Good morning , sir . - Morning , Margaret . Gears keep spinning on and on . Rotors on and on . It 's endless . - With no result in sight ? - No . Turing . - Turing , open the bloody door . - No . No . Open the door or we 'll break it down . I can 't let you in ! I cannot let you interfere . Go on , then . Turn that thing off . No . Don 't , please . Please . Please ! Please ! No ! No . No ! Well , then , it seems that your great big expensive machine doesn 't work . - It does . - Wonderful . So , you 've broken Enigma , then ? It was just ... still working . This is my associate from the Home Office . You see , a hundred thousand pounds is rather a lot of money , and he 's here to see what you have to show for it . You ... will never understand the importance of what I am creating here ! Have you decrypted any German messages ? A single one ? Can you point to anything at all that you 've achieved ? Your funding is up , and our patience is expired . It 's with such great pleasure that I am finally able to say this . Alan Turing , you 're fired . Please escort Mr . Turing from the premises . No . I beg your pardon ? If you fire Alan ... well , then you 'll have to fire me , too . What on earth are you saying ? Trust me when I tell you there is no one who would rather say this less than I do , but ... he 's right . Alan is right . His machine can work , and it 's probably the best chance that we 've got . God , it 's beyond belief . If you fire them ... you 'll have to fire me , too . And me . We 're the best cryptographic minds in Britain . Are you going to fire us all ? Commander , at least give us some more time . Six months , and if the machine doesn 't produce any results that we need , then we 'll go back to doing things the old way . How about that ? One month . And then , so help me God , you 're all gone . Oh , leave him . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . Oh , and , Alan , your machine ... it better bloody work . Hugh . I swear ... I 'm not a spy . Oh , for God 's sake , of course you 're not a bloody spy . What ? Denniston gave me the Beale cipher , and guess what ? I cracked it . " Ask , and it shall be given to you ; seek and ye shall find . " Matthew 7 : 7 . That was the key . Far too simple for the likes of you . Pity Denniston disagrees . Come in . Sir , I think I' ve got Turing . I tailed him to a pub last night , where he met a bloke . They exchanged an envelope . So , I follow this other fella , pick him up , give him a good shake . - He 's a poofter . He confessed . - What ? The man admitted it . Arnold Murray . Hangs around that pub ; men pay him for a go . Turing 's one of the men that paid . Only Mr . Murray here then has the bright idea of robbing Turing 's house after , with a friend . That 's what Turing 's hiding . Well , he 's a poof , not a spy . - No . - What 's the matter ? We can charge a university professor with indecency . No , this is ... it 's bloody rubbish . Turing 's up to something important ... He 's committed a crime and he 's broken the law . And with a bloke . Jesus Christ , it 's bloody disgusting . This isn 't the investigation I was conducting . - Bring him in . - Wait . Let me interrogate him . Please . Give me half an hour alone , and then I swear , I' ll spend the next month running errands on as many rubbish cases as you like . Fine . Now , will someone get me a warrant for the arrest of Alan Turing . Alan ? Christopher 's simply not moving fast enough . We should talk . And even with the diagonal board , he 's still not eliminating settings as quickly - as we need him to in order ... - I 'm leaving . But you 've just walked in . No . No . Bletchley . - What ? - It 's my parents . I 'm 25 , I 'm unmarried , I 'm living alone , and they want me home . - That 's ridiculous . - That 's my parents . You ... you can 't leave . I won 't let you . " I' ll miss you . " That 's what a normal person might say in this situation . - I don 't care what is normal . - What am I supposed to do , Alan ? I will not ... give up my parents . You ... you have an opportunity here to make some actual use of your life . And end up like you ? No , thanks . I 'm sorry you 're lonely . But Enigma will not save you . Can you decipher that , you fragile narcissist ? Or would you like me to go and fetch your precious Christopher to help ? I 'm sorry . I want you ... I want you to stay because I like you . I like ... talking to you . I like talking to you , too , Alan . And what if you weren 't alone ? What if you had a husband ? Do you have one in mind ? I do . Hugh ? Hugh 's terribly attractive , I' ll give you that , but ... I don 't really think he 's the marrying kind . - No , I wasn 't thinking of Hugh . - Or Peter . Peter 's so quiet . - Oh , my God . - But this makes sense . - Did you just propose to me ? - Well , it is the logical thing to do . - This is ridiculous . - This is your parents . I can 't ... believe that this is happening . Joan ... - Is your middle name Caroline or Catherine ? - Elizabeth . Joan Elizabeth ... Clarke ... will you marry me ? It 's beautiful . Well , I know it isn 't ordinary , but ... whoever loved ordinary ? She had it in both hands ... and she looked up at me with her doe eyes and said , " Am I supposed to put that in my mouth ? " And I said , " Yes . You know , the French way . " So , she pops it in , clamps her lips around it , and starts humming the bloody Marseillaise . Come have a dance . No , no , no , you can dance with your fiance anytime you like . Right now , this moment ... my turn . What 's the matter ? What if ... What if I don 't fancy being ... with Joan in that way ? Because you 're a homosexual ? I suspected . Well , should I tell her that I' ve had ... affairs with men ? You know , in my ... admittedly limited experience , women ... tend to be a bit touchy about accidentally marrying homosexuals . Perhaps not spreading this information about might be in your best interest . I care for her , I truly do . I ... I ... I just don 't know if I can ... - ... pretend . - You can 't tell anyone , Alan . It 's illegal . And Denniston is looking for any excuse he can to put you away . - I know . - This has to stay a secret . Come on , it 's your turn . Okay . - Cup of tea ? - No , thank you . Mr . Turing , can I tell you a secret ? - I 'm quite good with those . - I 'm here to help you . Oh , clearly . Can machines think ? Oh , so , you 've read some of my published works ? What makes you say that ? Well , because I 'm sitting in a police station , accused of entreating a young man to touch my penis and you just asked me if machines can think . Well , can they ? Could machines ever think as human beings do ? Most people say not . You 're not most people . Well , the problem is you 're ... asking a stupid question . I am ? Of course machines can 't think as people do . A machine is different ... from a person . Hence , they think differently . The interesting question is , just because something thinks differently from you , does that mean it 's not thinking ? Well , we allow for humans to have such divergences from one another . You like strawberries , I hate ice- skating , you ... cry at sad films , I ... am allergic to pollen . What is the point of different tastes , different ... preferences if not to say that our brains work differently , that we think differently ? If we can say that about one another , then why can 't we say the same thing for brains ... built of copper and wire , steel ? And that 's ... this big paper you wrote ? What 's it called ? " The Imitation Game . " Right , that 's ... that 's what it 's about ? - Would you like to play ? - Play ? It 's a game . A test of sorts . For determining whether something is a ... a machine or a human being . How do I play ? Well , there 's a judge and a subject , and ... the judge asks questions , and ... depending on the subject 's answers , determines who he is talking with ... what he is talking with , and ... All you have to do is ask me a question . - What did you do during the war ? - I worked in a radio factory . What did you really do during the war ? Are you paying attention ? Damn it ! We 're soon out of time . A month . So , that 's it , then , is it ? Oh , the trouble is , it doesn 't matter how much we improve it . The machine 's never gonna be able to process 159 million million million possibilities in time . It 's just bloody hopeless . It 's searching . It 's just ... It ... doesn 't know what it 's searching for . If we knew what the messages were going to say ... If we knew what the messages were going to say , we wouldn 't have to decrypt them at all . Who 's Alan´s friend ? Hugh . He 's a bit of a cad , actually . So , my type , then ? - Well , I' ll introduce you . - No . He 'll come over . - Are you sure ? - Yes . I smiled at him 15 minutes ago and haven 't looked back since . Who 's that with Joan ? Helen . Works with her . - She 's really pretty . - She wants me to come over . What ? How on earth can you know that ? She smiled at me a while back and she hasn 't looked again since . And got him . Now , why is this , that when I was single I found it very boring , but now that I 'm engaged , I just find it dreadfully fun . Bingo . She 's in . - Alan , introduce us . - What ? Why me ? Because there 's nothing like a friend 's engagement to make a woman want to do something she 'll later regret with the fiance 's better looking chum . Let 's go . Half a crown says Alan bollixes this up entirely . No bet . - Alan Turing has a theory . - He has many . He believes that the regulations against men and women working side by side are sound because such proximity will necessarily lead to romance . What ? No , I don 't . I ... - However I disagree . - You do ? Yeah . I think that if I were working beside a woman all day long , I could appreciate her abilities and intellect without taking her to bed . I 'm sorry , have we met ? I don 't recall . But let 's assume we haven 't . Helen Stewart . Hugh Alexander . So , who do you agree with , Alan or myself ? Well , Alan , of course . I 'm very flattered , really , but I don 't think ... Rubbish . Well , I work beside a man every day , and I can 't help but have developed a bit of a crush on him . Well , who is this man ? So I can kick his arse . Well , there 's no need to worry , it 's been chaste . We 've never even met . He 's a German . Now I really want to kill him . How do you mean you work alongside a German ? Well , each of us intercepts messages from a specific German radio tower . So , we have a counterpart on the other side who 's tip- tapping out the messages . Everyone types a touch differently , so you get to know the rhythm of your counterpart . It 's strangely intimate . I feel as if I know him so well . It 's a pity he has a girlfriend , but that 's why I disagree with you , Mr . Alexander . Because I 'm in love with a coworker of sorts , and we 've never even met . Well , allow me to buy you another pint , and I' ll tell you why you 're wrong . Let 's . Excellent . Thanks . Pints . Have you got any sloe gin ? In case you were wondering , that 's what flirting looks like . Helen ... Alan ? Yes , Alan ? Why do you think your German counterpart has a girlfriend ? - It 's just a stupid joke , don 't worry . - No , no , no , no . Tell me . Well , each of his messages begins with the same five letters : C- I- L- L- Y . So , I suspect that Cilly must be the name of his amore . But that 's impossible . The Germans are instructed to use five random letters - at the start of every message . - Well , this bloke doesn 't . Love will make a man do strange things , I suppose . In this case , love just lost Germany the whole bloody war . Go , Peter . Sorry . Alan ! Alan ! Alan ! I just want ... Hugh Alexander . John Cairncross . Peter bloody Hilton . Alan ? What ... ? What ... What if ... what if Christopher doesn 't have to search through all of the settings ? What if he only has to search through ones that produce words we already know will be in the message ? - Repeated words , predictable words . - Exactly . Look , look , like this one . " 0600 hours . Weather today is clear . Rain in the evening . Heil Hitler . " Well , that 's it . Exactly . They send a weather report every day at 6 : 00 a . m . So , that 's three words we know will be in every 6 : 00 a . m . message ... " weather , " obviously , and ... - Heil bloody Hitler . - Heil bloody Hitler . Here 's the 6 : 00 message from this morning . Hugh , the the right- hand letter wheel , set them to ... I know , I know . " Weather " and " Hitler . " Peter , John , run voltages through those letters , through the back scramblers . So , we 'll use the loops ? Yes . Joan , what was the last 6 : 00 a . m . message ? - L . - L . - H . - H . - W . - W . - A . - A . - Q . - Q . Done . Come on . Come on . Come on , Christopher . Oh , my God . What happened ? - Did it work ? - Alan ? Alan ! Alan ! I need a new message . The latest intercept . Thank you . O ... T . - Ready ? - Yes . - M . - M . - Y . - Y . - M . S . - M . S . - A . I . - A . I . - C . - C . - T . R . - T . R . - I . S . - I . S . - O . A . - O . A . - Y . R . - Y . R . - I . - I . " KMS Jaguar is aufpunkt is directed to 53 degrees 24 minutes north and aufpunkt one ... degree west . " Heil Hitler . Turns out that 's the only German you need to know to break Enigma . Yes ! - M . - M . - A . - A . - Y . - Y . - I . - I . - T . - T . - R . - R . - O . - O . T . - T . A . - A . - H . - H . - Q . - Q . - U . - U . R . R . My God , you did it . You just defeated Nazism with a crossword puzzle . There are five people in the world who know the position of every ship in the Atlantic . - They 're all in this room . - Oh , good God . Oh , I don 't think even He has the power that we do right now . No . There 's going to be an attack on a British passenger convoy . Right there . God , you 're right . All those U- boats are only 20 , 30 minutes away . Civilians . Hundreds of them . We can save their lives . I' ll phone Denniston 's office so that he can alert the Admiralty . Do you think there 's enough time to save them ? There should be , if we can get a message ... Commander Denniston 's office , please . It 's urgent . No . - What the hell are you doing ? - You can 't call Denniston . - You can 't tell him about the attack . - What are you talking about ? We can have air support over that convoy in ten minutes . Let the U- boats sink the convoy . It 's been a big day , maybe you 're suffering ... - We don 't have time ... - No ! - Hugh ! Hugh ! That 's enough ! That 's enough ! - Stop , Hugh ! John , the attack is in minutes . Yes , no , I 'm fine , I 'm fine . I 'm fine . You know why people like violence , Hugh ? It 's because it feels good . Sometimes we can 't do what feels good . - We have to do what is logical . - What 's logical ? Hardest time to lie to somebody is when they 're expecting to be lied to . - Oh , God . - What ? If someone 's waiting for a lie , you can 't just give them one . - Damn it , Alan 's right . - What ? What would the Germans think if we destroy their U- boats ? - Nothing . They 'll be dead . - No . No , you can 't be right . So , our convoy suddenly veers off course ... a squadron of our air bombers miraculously descends on the coordinates of the U- boats ... what will the Germans think ? The Germans will know that we have broken Enigma . They 'll stop all radio communications by midday , and they 'll have changed the design of Enigma by the weekend . Yes . Two years´ work . Everything that we 've done here will all be for nothing . There are 500 civilians in that convoy . Women , children . We 're about to let them die . Our job is not to save one passenger convoy , it is to win the war . - Our job was to crack Enigma . - We 've done that . Now for the hard part . - Keeping it a secret . - Carlisle . What ? The convoy you 're about to ... it 's ... The HMS Carlisle is one of the ships . We can 't act on every piece of intelligence . So , fine , we won 't . - Just this one . - Peter , what 's the matter with you ? My brother 's ... well , he 's on the Carlisle . A gunnery ensign . I 'm ... I 'm so sorry . Who the hell do you think you are ? This ... this is my brother . He 's my big brother , all right , and you have a few minutes to call off his murder . We can 't . He 's right . Alan . Joan . Hugh . John . Please , I ... The Germans , they won 't get suspicious just because we stop one attack . No one will know . I 'm asking you as your friend . Please . I 'm so sorry . You 're not God , Alan , you don 't get to decide who lives and who dies . Yes , we do . Why ? Because no one else can . Why are you telling me this ? We need your help to keep this a secret from Admiralty , Army , RAF . No one can know we broke Enigma . Not even Denniston . Who 's in the process of having you fired . You can take care of that . While we develop a system to help you determine how much intelligence to act on ... which attacks to stop , which to let through . Statistical analysis . The minimal number of actions it would take for us to win the war ... but the maximum number we can take before the Germans get suspicious . And you 're going to trust all this to statistics ? - To maths ? - Correct . And then MI6 can come up with the lies that we tell everybody else . You 'll need a believable alternative source for all the pieces of information you use . A false story so that we can explain how we got our information that has nothing to do with Enigma . And then you can leak those stories to the Germans . And then to our own military . Maintain a conspiracy of lies at the highest levels of government . Sounds right up my alley . Alan , I so rarely have cause to say this , but you are exactly the man I always hoped you would be . They code- named it " Ultra . " It became the largest store of military intelligence in ... the history of the world . It was like having a tap on Himmler 's intercom . I- E- O ... Secrecy became the primary concern , and for some reason , they ... they trusted me . Peter , do you have the ... 630 decryp ... It 's a Beale cipher encrypted with a phrase from a book or ... " Ask , and it will be given to you ; seek and you will find . " Matthew 7 : 7 . That was the key . Peter will come around eventually . Jack . Could you give Alan and me a moment , please ? The Soviets and us , we 're on the same side . What I 'm doing will help Britain . I have to tell Denniston . No , you don 't . Because if you tell him my secret ... I' ll tell him yours . Do you know what they do to homosexuals ? You 'll never be able to work again , never be able to teach . Your precious machine ... I doubt you 'll ever see him again . Hello . Can I ... can I speak to Stewart Menzies , please ? It 's urgent . One moment , please . Hello . Menzies . Some advice about keeping secrets . It 's a lot easier if you don 't know them in the first place . Were they steaming my letters , tapping my telephone ? Trailing my nervous walks ? You know , I ... I never did find out . Joan ? Joan ? What 's ... Where 's Joan ? Military prison . What have you done ? Decoded Enigma intercepts . I found a pile of them in the bedside table . No , no . I gave those to her over a year ago when I was trying to figure out - a link between ... - I 'm sure you did . Denniston 's been looking for a Soviet spy . He 's been looking inside Hut 8 . I know who the spy is . It 's not Joan . It 's ... it 's Cairncross . I found the Beale cipher , the Bible . God , I wish you 'd been a spy . You 'd be so much better at this than he is . You knew it was him ? Of course I bloody knew . I knew before he came to Bletchley . Why do you think I had him placed here ? But we have an Enigma machine . Yeah , Polish Intelligence ... You placed a ... a Soviet agent at Bletchley Park ? It 's really quite useful to be able to leak whatever we want to Stalin . Churchill 's too damn paranoid . He won 't share a shred of intelligence with the Soviets . Not even information that will help them against the Germans . There 's ... so much secrecy . Cairncross has no idea we know , of course . He 's really not the brightest bulb . Which is why I need your help . I want to know what to leak to John , what to feed to the Soviets , as well as the British . I 'm not a spy . I 'm ... I 'm just a mathematician . I know a lot of spies , Alan . You 've got more secrets than the best of them . You ... you have to promise me that you will release Joan . Yes , Joan 's at the market . She 's gonna be back in an hour . I lied . I better hold on to these . If anybody finds out about them , prison will be the least of her worries . Oh , Alan ... we 're gonna have such a wonderful war together . - I need you to leave Bletchley . - What ? It 's Menzies . I don 't trust him . It 's not safe here . - Do you think it 's any safer anywhere else ? - You need to get away . - You need to get very far away from me . - Alan , what 's happened ? We can 't be engaged anymore . You ... your parents need to take you back and find you a husband elsewhere . What 's wrong with you ? I have something to tell you . I 'm ... I 'm a homosexual . All right . No , no . Men , Joan ... - not women . - So what ? - Well , I just told you . - So what ? I had my suspicions ; I always did . But we 're not like other people . We love each other in our own way , and we can have the life together that we want . You ... you won 't be the perfect husband . Well , I can promise you , I have no intention of being the perfect wife . I' ll not be ... fixing your lamb all day while you come home from the office . I' ll work . You 'll work . And we 'll have each other 's company . We 'll have each other 's minds . That sounds like a better marriage than most . Because I care for you . And you care for me . And we understand one another more than ... more than anyone else ever has . I don 't . - What ? - Care for you . I never did . I just needed you to break Enigma . I' ve done that now , so ... so you can go . I 'm not going anywhere . I' ve spent entirely too much of my life worried about what you think of me , or what my parents think of me , or the boys in Hut 8 or the girls in Hut 3 . And do you know what ? I 'm done . This is the most important work I will ever do , and no one is going to stop me . Least of all , you . You know what , they were right . Peter , Hugh , John . You really are a monster . The war dragged on for two more ... solitary years ... and every day we performed our blood- soaked calculus . Every day we decided who lived and who died . Every day we ... helped the Allies to victories , and nobody knew . Stalingrad . The Ardenne . The invasion of Normandy . All victories that would not have been possible without the intelligence that we supplied . And people ... talk about the war as this epic battle between ... civilizations ... freedom versus tyranny , democracy versus Nazism , armies of millions bleeding into the ground , fleets of ships weighing down the oceans , planes dropping bombs from the sky until they obliterated the sun itself ... the war wasn 't like that for us . For us , it was just ... half a dozen crossword enthusiasts in a tiny village in the South of England . This is ... your victory . Victory ... of the cause of freedom in every land . This is a solemn but glorious hour . I wish that Franklin D . Roosevelt had lived to see this day . Was I God ? No . Because ... God didn 't win the war . We did . So , what happens now ? Is it ... back to university for us , I suppose ? Yes , pretty much . But you 've one thing left to do before your service to your government in concluded . - What 's that ? - Burn everything . - Burn ? Why ? - You were told when you started this was a top- secret program . Did you think we were joking ? - But the war is over . - This war is . But there 'll be others . And we know how to break a code that everybody else believes is unbreakable . Precisely . Tear it down . Light it up . Sweep away the ashes . None of you have ever met before . None of you have ever even heard the word Enigma . Have a safe trip home . Behave . With a bit of luck , you 'll never have to see me or one another again for the rest of your lives . That 's unbelievable . Now , Detective , you get to judge . So , tell me ... what am I ? Am I ... a machine ? Am I a person ? Am I a war hero ? Am I a criminal ? I can 't judge you . Well , then ... you 're no help to me at all . Come in . You wanted to see me , sir ? Turing . Sit down . Something the matter ? You and Christopher Morcom are quite close . I wouldn 't say that . Well , your mathematics teacher says the two of you are positively inseparable . We 're the best students in the class . He caught you passing notes the other day . Cryptography , to pass the time . The class is too simple . You and your friend solve maths problems during maths class because the maths class is too dull ? He 's not my friend . - Well , I 'm told he 's your only friend . - Who said that ? Something 's come up concerning Morcom . Why am I here ? Christopher is dead . I don 't understand . His mother sent word this morning . The family were on holiday , you see . I don 't understand . Well , he had bovine tuberculosis , as I 'm sure he told you . So , this won 't come as a shock , but ... still , all the same , I 'm sorry . You 're mistaken . Did he not tell you ? Well , he 's been sick for a long time . He knew this was coming soon . But he had a stiff upper lip about it . Good lad . - Are you all right , Turing ? - Yes . Of course . Like I said , I didn 't know him very well . I see . Very well . May I leave , Headmaster ? Congratulations , sir . Sorry . I would have come . I would have testified . And what would you have said , that I ... I wasn 't a homosexual . Alan ... this is serious . They could send you to jail . Damn it . - Your hands . You 're twitching . - No , I 'm not . Alan . It 's the medication . The medication ? Well , the judge gave me a choice ... either two years in prison or hormonal therapy . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Yes , yes , that 's right . Chemical castration . To ... to cure me of my homosexual predilections . Well , of course I chose that . I mean , I ... couldn 't ... work in prison , and ... All right . Now , I 'm going to speak to your doctors . I 'm going to speak to your lawyers . I 'm fine . - Please let me help you . - No , I don 't need your help , thank you . Alan , you do not have to do this alone . I 'm not alone . Never have been . Christopher 's become so smart . If I don 't continue my treatment , then they 'll ... they 'll take him away from me . You ... You can 't let them do that . You can 't . You ... you can 't let them leave me alone . I don 't ... I don 't want to be alone . I don 't want to be alone . All ri ... all right , all right . All right . It 's all right . Come and sit down . It 's all right . Come and sit down . It 's all right . Oh , well , that 's a ... that 's a much nicer ring than the one I made you . Yes . His name 's Jock . He 's an Army man , if you can believe it . We work together . Why don 't we do a crossword puzzle . It 'll only take us five minutes . Or , in your case , six . There . Perhaps later . Yes , of course . You got what you wanted , didn 't you ? Work , a husband . Normal life . No one normal could have done that . Do you know , this morning ... I was on a train that went through a city that wouldn 't exist if it wasn 't for you . I bought a ticket from a man who would likely be dead if it wasn 't for you . I read up on my work ... a whole field of scientific inquiry that only exists because of you . Now , if you wish you could have been normal ... I can promise you I do not . The world is an infinitely better place precisely because you weren 't . Do you ... do you really think that ? I think ... that sometimes it is the people who no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine . When I think of my wife ... I always think of her head ... I picture cracking her lovely skull ... Unspooling her brains ... Trying to get answers ... The primal questions of any marriage . What are you thinking ? How are you feeling ? What have we done to each other ? The Irish prince graces us with his presence . His majesty prefers not to be moistened . I got you a present . I hated this game . You loved it . You loved it . Thank you . I' ll add it to the collection . Can you pour me a bourbon ? What 's up , jitters ? Well , if you 're not going to talk , I 'm gonna have to fill the silence ... With another excruciating story by margo dunne . I could tell you about my recent customer service experience ... Changing Internet service providers . I like that one . Or how about the time I saw that woman who looked exactly like my friend Monica ? But it wasn 't Monica . It was a total stranger . Who was also named Monica . Made it kind of interesting . It 's great . I 'm just having a bad day . Amy ? It 's our anniversary . Five years . Five ? That came fast . And furious . I 'm so crazy , stupid happy . I met a boy . A great , sweet , gorgeous , cool ass guy . Excuse me , miss ? I just want you to be careful ... Where you put down that monk brewed Belgian wheat beer ... Because the party 's down to three beast lights and a bottle of pucker . It might attract some desperate characters . It could . I mean , the amish are on a rumspringa . They already relieved me of my artisanal meat platter . Finally , someone tells me how to pronounce that word . Meat ? Yes , meat . One syllable . Thank you . Whose beer am I about to drink ? Don 't tell me . Let 's see , who 's your type ? I don 't see you sitting quietly ... While he bloviates on his postgrad thesis about proust . Uh oh . Is that him ? Ironic hipster , so self aware , he makes everything a joke . I prefer men who are funny , not funny . What type are you ? Corn fed , salt of the earth Missouri guy . Missouri ? Cute . Native new yorker ? The world ends at the Hudson . What 's your name ? Amy . Well , Amy , who are you ? A , I 'm an award winning scrimshander . B , I 'm a moderately influential warlord .

So I 'd recognize you . I 'm gonna go with c . And you ? Who are you ? I 'm the guy to save you from all this awesomeness . So , you write for a men 's magazine . God , does that make you an expert on being a man ? No . It 's what to wear , what to drink . How to bullshit . Never with you . Ha , ha . No , I mean it . It 's hard to believe you . Why ? I think it 's your chin . My chin ? Yeah , it 's quite villainous . Okay , how 's this ? A hundred percent true , no bullshit . Okay . We all move to New York ... And we end up living in these little cubby holes , and that 's not it . Come outside . Then , you 're in it . You have to see this . Hey . Hey . I have to kiss you now . Is that right ? I can 't let you go through a sugar storm unkissed . Wait a second . There you go . Nick dunne ... I really like you . So , is Amy gonna do one of those anniversary ... Treasure hunts ? You mean the forced march designed to prove ... What an oblivious and uncaring asshole her husband is ? Wow . Life . I don 't remember the point . Deep hasbro thoughts . Spin . What was the clue last year she got so mad about ? When your poor Amy has a cold ... This dessert just must be sold . The answer ? I still don 't know the answer , go . A few years ago , you 'd have known . A few years ago , it was fun . Year one , the traditional gift was paper . She got me a beautiful notebook . Told me to go write my novel . What did you get her ? A kite . She 'd never flown a kite . Okay . Anyway . Year four , flowers . She led me outside to the dying rosebush in the backyard . That 's symbolic . Yeah . What 's the gift for five ? Wood . So , what did you get her ? There 's no good gift for wood . I know ! Go home , fuck her brains out , slap her with your penis . There 's some wood for you , bitch . The bar . Why , yes . Hang on one second . Hey , it 's watchful Wally . Hey , Walt . What 's going on ? Thanks very much . I' ll be right there . All right , bye bye . Hey , buddy . What are you doing out here ? Thanks , Walt ! Ame ? Amy ! Hello ? Come on in . Hey . Mister dunne . Hi . I 'm detective Rhonda boney . This is officer James gilpin . We understand there are concerns about your wife . I don 't know where my wife is . And I came home to this . Now , I don 't panic easily ... But it 's weird , right ? Mind if we look around ? Please . How long have you two been here ? Two years in September . We used to live in New York . City ? Yeah , I was a writer . We were both writers . Why did you all move back here ? My mom got sick . Oh , I 'm sorry . How is she ? She 's dead . I 'm so sorry . What do you do now , for work ? My sister margo and I own the bar downtown . Oh , the bar . Love the name . Very meta . Thanks . Pretty things . Stay . My office , here . Beautiful dress . Date night ? It 's our anniversary . It 's a guest bedroom , there . Cat 's room on the end . I checked up here . This is the kitchen ... Obviously . This is my wife 's office . Amy 's office . Wow . Impressive gal . Yeah . Should I be concerned ? I remember these . I loved these books . Wait a minute . Your wife is amazing Amy ? Yeah . She is . Wow . Amazing fucking Amy is getting fucking married . That 's how the night started . With me , regular , flawed , real Amy , jealous , as always , of the golden child . Perfect , brilliant , amazing Amy , who 's getting fucking married . When I was 10 , I quit cello . In the next book , amazing Amy became a prodigy . Did you play volleyball ? I got cut , freshman year . She made varsity . When did you have a dog ? She got the dog . Puddles made her more relatable . Wow . I love your parents ... But they really can be assholes . Nick ! Sir ! Hey , thanks for coming , man . No problem . Hey , sweetheart . Big night for your mom . It would mean so much if you would talk to a few reporters ... Bloggers , give them a little Amy color . People wanna hear from you . We can 't stay long . Fantastic . Fifteen minutes , tops . This is why I have my brownstone . My trust fund . I know I can 't complain . Your parents literally plagiarized your childhood . No , they improved upon it , and then peddled it to the masses . I thought you were gonna wear white to match the wedding theme . I thought that would be creepy . If it 's worth doing , it 's worth doing hold up ! I know how this ends . Don 't tell me . You 're very cute , Nick . Amy , you know what would make dad 's night . I 'm on it . I love having strangers pick at my scabs . I 'm curious whether ... It 's difficult for you to see amazing Amy heading down the aisle . And this big party celebrating this fictional wedding . Because it 's my understanding you are not married . Is that correct ? Correct . Amazing Amy has always been one step ahead of me . Excuse me . I 'm sorry , I just have a few questions . It 's you . I 'm here in a strictly journalistic capacity . Now , you had the distinct pleasure of dating Nick dunne for how long ? Two magical years . Two magical years . In the course of that time , you 've had the opportunity ... To perform such gracious gestures as ... Not correcting Nick when he pronounced quinoa as kween o a . An understandable mistake . He also thought it was a fish . He thinks velveeta is a cheese . You also manage to appear shocked and delighted ... When Nick 's elderly mother breaks into an impromptu rendition ... Of New York , New York , every time she sees you . [ S ] These bag of bone shoes that 's just frightening . You also bought Nick his very first pair of scissors . And matching stapler . Amy elliott , you are more than amazing . You are brilliant , yet entirely un snobby . You challenge me . You surprise me . And , fun fact for the readers ... You have a world class vagina . My colleagues tell me that you are not yet married . Is that correct ? I 'm not . Isn 't it time we fixed that ? And then ... The night wasn 't so bad anymore . And it 's done . Crossed off the list . Now , normally , we would not treat this as a missing persons case so quick ... But given the scene at your house ... And given our spike in violent crime of late ... We are gonna take this very , very seriously . Okay . Good . We 've got forensics over at your place . You got somewhere to stay ? I could stay at my sister 's . Okay . We 're tracking Amy 's phone , her credit cards . We will organize searches , put up flyers . We 're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow . You 're having a press conference ? I wanna get the word out , right ? Yeah , it 's just all of a sudden , I feel like I 'm on a law & order episode . Time is of the essence in these cases . But , that said , do you wanna wait and call a lawyer ? Absolutely not . I just wanna help . So , you and Amy have been here two years . You tend bar I own the bar . And I teach creative writing at mvcc . No kids ? Not yet . So , what does Amy do most days ? A woman with all those degrees , what does she do ? I don 't know . She keeps busy . Doing what ? She 's a voracious reader . So , she 's always got a book in her hand . Well , days can get long . I know a few housewives , that evening glass of wine starts coming at noon . Or prescription pills . Just last week , we had a soccer mom . Nice lady . Got her teeth kicked in over some oxycontin . Ever since that mall went bust , half the town is out of work . We cannot keep up with the drug violence . I 'm pretty sure that 's not it . Has Amy got friends we can talk to ? No , not really . No friends ? This whole town ? She was very close with my mom , before she passed away . You know , we have a pretty serious homeless problem ... In our neighborhood . I think maybe you guys should check that out . We 'll look into that . You got to the bar around 11 : 00 today . Where were you before that ? Just to cross that out . Well , I was home . I left at 9 : 30 , I got a cup of coffee , a newspaper . I went to Sawyer beach and read the news . Did you visit with anyone there ? I kind of go to Sawyer beach for the solitude . So , your wife has no friends here . Is she kinda standoffish ? Ivy league ? Rubs people the wrong way ? She 's from New York . She 's complicated . She 's got very high standards . Type a ? That can make you crazy if you 're not like that . You seem pretty laid back . Type b . Speaking of which , Amy 's blood type ? God , I don 't know . I 'd have to look it up at the house . You don 't know if she has friends , you don 't know what she does all day ... And you don 't know your wife 's blood type . Sure you all are married ? Maybe it 's type o . Where are her folks ? New York ? Yeah . Can they get here time for this press conference tomorrow ? Tomorrow ? I have no idea . I haven 't talked to them . You haven 't called your wife 's parents yet ? You can 't get a signal in this building . I' ve been in here talking to you . Call them , please , Nick . Now . Fine . Should I know my wife 's blood type ? No . I apologize , marybeth . I didn 't know what was going on . Now I 'm at the station ... And the cops are at the house , and it 's serious and I 'm calling you . There 's a lot of things that are being juggled right now . I 'm standing right next to detective Rhonda boney ... Who 's the lead investigator on this and she 's ... My mother in law would like to speak with you . This is detective boney . I wanna go home . I don 't know why I have to be here . I don 't wanna be here . I wanna go home . Dad ? This is my father . What 's going on ? Really ? You 're Nick dunne ? We 've been trying to get a hold of you all afternoon . I' ve been right there . My wife is missing . Bitch . Don 't . Your father wandered out of comfort hill after lunch . We found him walking route 79 , disoriented . We 've been trying to call you for the last I don 't get a cell signal in this building . I' ve been sitting 20 feet away from you .

Get your fucking hands off me . Thanks . Everyone told us and told us and told us ... Marriage is hard work . And compromise and more work . Abandon all hope , ye who enter . When young Amy 's hope did wane ... She wandered here ... Well , it 's not true . Not for me and Nick . ... in search of Jane . With us , two years ... It 's just good . Austen . You were an alienated teen and only Elizabeth Bennet understood you . Look at that . My God . You naughty minx . Well , technically , we are supposed to fuck at the next stop . Yeah , in keeping with tradition . But I might be willing to bend the rules this once . God bless Jane Austen . I 'm enthusiastic . Look at that . It 's confirmed by the ... Thank you . Year two . Cotton . We had that joke that our sex was too good for ordinary . So , these are 2, 000 thread count we 're so cute . I wanna punch us in the face . That 's pretty great . I mean , that is pretty great . Did they ask if you wanted a lawyer ? I don 't need a lawyer . Here , I' ll do this . Well , did they ask personal stuff about Amy ? You know , they asked ... Why didn 't she have any friends ? What did you say ? I said she was complicated . Nick ! Everyone knows complicated is code for bitch . God . I feel sick . Thanks . It 's so bizarre . It seems like the kind of thing that would happen to Amy . She always attracts drama ? You can say it . It 's just me and you . Just because I don 't like to be around Amy ... Doesn 't mean I don 't care about her . Anyway , whoever took her is bound to bring her back . Detective ? Excuse me . I 'm noelle hawthorne . I 'm Amy´s best friend . Well , great . Where do you live , noelle ? Five doors down . 1032 . Wonderful . I would love to talk to you . Can I come by in half an hour ? Y' all know anything yet ? I 'm sorry .

Interesting . What 's that ? House is rented in her name . Car 's in her name . Credit cards , utilities , phone bill , all in her name . Even his bar 's in her name .

You 've been up all night . You wanna look like you 've been up all night . Hey , be careful today , okay ? That 's a weird thing to say . Well , when you 're upset , you bottle up . You can seem angry , like please don 't say , like dad . Or else you swing into your momma 's boy charm offensive and that can feel glib . Perfect . I' ll balance on the exact fucking edge of your emotional razor . Okay . Just be ... Myself ? ... sponsoring a raffle to benefit west county 4h ... And raffling season tickets for mizzou football . Buy your tickets at the wing hut or local tri state tire stores . Your in laws made it . Hi , rand . Hey , man . I 'm detective boney . I 'm the twin . Margo . We played tennis yesterday , Nick .

Are you following me ? What you doing ? Like you said , it 's my dad 's house . I come by once a week , make sure the place hasn 't burned down . But it looks okay . I' ll walk you out . You know ... I thought maybe this was the little brown house . From the clue . Nope . Still blue . Picture me , I 'm a girl who 's very , very bad . I need to be punished , and by punished , I mean had . It 's where you keep goodies for anniversary five . So open the door , and look alive . Bitch ! Want to test your marriage for weak spots ? Add one recession ... Subtract two jobs . It 's surprisingly effective . Promise me we 'll never be like them . Like who ? All those awful couples we know . Those wives who treat their men like dancing monkeys ... To be trained and paraded . Husbands who treat their wives like the highway patrol ... To be out foxed and avoided . I think I 'm gonna be laid off . We 're in a recession . If it happens , we 'll deal with it . I' ll probably be next . We have each other . Everything else is background noise . You are exceptional . My turn . My parents´ publisher dropped them , and they 're in debt up to their ears . That 's terrible . And they need to borrow from my trust fund . How much ? Almost a million . That 's almost all of it . This is where you say , everything else is background noise . Amy , if you 're laid off ... And I 'm laid off ... I said I 'd do it . Without talking to me ? Well , it 's ... Your call . ... their money , technically . You know what ? You 're right . Everything else is just background noise . Hey . More games ? Yeah , I just wanted to shoot some folks . What 's the laptop for ? Laptop ing . I see . You can give your parents $879, 000 without talking to me ... But God forbid I buy a video game without getting your permission . You are spending a lot . You don 't trust me . You don 't trust my judgment . You certainly don 't trust my intention . What are you talking about ? That 's the basic tenet of a prenup , isn 't it ? Why are you throwing that in my face again ? Because it 's easy to throw . Nick , I don 't get it . I don 't get why you 're daring me to be someone I don 't wanna be . The nagging shrew . The controlling bitch . I 'm not that person . I 'm your wife . I 'm sorry . I just don 't know how to do this . I' ve never not had a job . I flipped burgers , I painted houses . You 'll get another job . Hi , go . What ? Hold on . What ? And suddenly ... Slow down , what is it ? ... I knew everything was about to get worse . Okay , tell me what 's wrong . Bless you , Nick . Father . Hey , tom . Mayor ! Nick , good to see you . Good to see you . Hey , guys , hey . Jodie . Nick . Oh , we 'll find her . You look like hammered shit . Thank you . You ever see that guy in the glasses before ? Don 't worry . We videotape everybody that comes in and out of these things . I mean , you tend to get a lot of ... Do gooders ? Freaks . Hey , I meant to ask you . Noelle hawthorne ? She lives on your street . Amy 's best friend . I' ve never heard the name noelle hawthorne . She and her husband have triplets . Oh . Yeah , we might say hi to them on the street . But best friend ? No . Excuse me , one sec . He acted like noelle was a complete stranger . Of course he did . Look , these two are yours . Oh , look . He 's being a good guy ... So everybody can see him being a good guy . You really don 't like him , do you ? What 's to like ? This mailbox is currently full . Press one to Nick ? I just wanted to introduce myself . My name 's shawna Kelly . I am so sorry for your troubles . Thank you . That 's kind . Are you remembering to eat ? Well , a lot of cold cuts . I 'm gonna fix you up my world famous chicken frito pie . That 's very kind and very unnecessary . You have to keep your strength . Would you ... Say , chicken frito pie ! You know what ? Would you delete that picture for me ? It 's a nice photo . I know it is . But just do me a favor . Will you ? Would you go ahead and please delete that picture ? You just press ... What is wrong with you ? Could you please not share that with anyone ? I will share it with whomever I please . Dude . Yeah ? Marybeth is pissed . Why ? Marybeth ? It 's like you 're the goddamn homecoming king . It was important to my mother that I be polite ... I be considerate , I be a gentleman . It looked like you were having fun . I am in a nightmare ! All I 'm trying to do is be nice ... To the people who are volunteering to help find Amy . You 're right . And I 'm sorry . My God , this place literally smells like feces . In your searches , did you find any golf clubs , real fancy ? No . How about a brand new stratocaster ? No , nothing like that . Well , all right . How big 's that TV ? It 's not 65 inch . No , it 's nowhere near that . Okay . Kibble ? Excuse me ? He asked me to feed his cat . I saw some in the pantry . Detective boney , officer gilpin ? Noelle hawthorne ! I know y' all are in there ! Would you please escort miss hawthorne and her children back out to the street ? Detective boney ! Just remind her it is a possible crime scene . Look at that pie eating grin , from a guy whose wife is missing . How are you doing ? Terrific . How 's marybeth ? She 's a wreck . And you ? Awesome . Hey ... Have you told me everything ? Of course . Everything ? Why would you even ask me that ? Ever since you walked into the bar that morning Amy went missing , you seem ... Off . I am off . Everybody 's examining me and projecting their shit on me . All I want is to come over here , have a beer with you ... And not be judged . Can we do that ? Of course . You know what I keep thinking ? If mom were here ? Yeah . Like I 'm 12 . Nick , mom would fix it . I 'm gonna go Benadryl myself to sleep . Love you . Love you . So , here 's a strange , new sentence . I am a missourian . Bye , dad . No money , no jobs , no prospects . And then , we heard from go . Mama Maureen ... Stage 4 breast cancer . So , we moved to Missouri . I don 't mind . I just wish he 'd asked . Nick is happy to be home . But I don 't know if he 's happy I 'm with him . I feel like something he loaded by mistake . Something to be jettisoned , if necessary . Something disposable . I feel like I could disappear . Oh , my God ! I saw you on TV . Okay . It 's so crazy . Yeah , I know . She just vanished ? She 's just gone . I' ve been so worried about you . Where have you been ? I called you a hundred times . You gotta pick up your phone ! Rehearsals . What ? Godspell . My sister 's asleep in the other room . I needed to see you . I know this is a bad idea . Can you at least tell me you love me ? I do love you , but we have to be really careful right now . I' ve been so scared . Between rehearsals ? You told me I needed to have my own life . I know . We need to stop . I need you . Touch me . Stop it . Come here . Sit down . Okay . Did you , by any chance , tell anybody anything about us ? Even in texting , or on Facebook . Facebook ? I use the disposable phone . You buy my presents in cash . I 'm not stupid , Nick . I know , sweetie . Did you leave a pair of red panties in my office ? I don 't know . Maybe . They better be mine . Sweetheart , think . I don 't know . I 'd have to check my red panty inventory . Andie , I need you to take this seriously , okay ? This is the last time we 're gonna see each other , until ... Until when ? Until it 's safe . You were going to get a divorce . Never say that out loud again . Okay . I 'm sorry . I don 't wanna fight . I just wanna be with you . Andie , please ... That 's all I want . I can 't . It 's our last time together . Let 's make the most of it . Real quick , but then you have to go . My husband has come undone . We moved to Missouri to save Maureen ... But as it turns out , we couldn 't . It means a lot that you came . We took a hit on the brownstone ... And I used the last of my trust fund to buy him a bar . So far , it 's just costing money . Nick uses me for sex when he wants . Otherwise , I don 't exist . We should go to outback tonight . That would be nice . Last night , I went from desperate to pathetic . I became someone I don 't even like . The kind of woman I used to mock . You 're out so much . I know . Stay home . I can 't , I 'm already late . Then , can I come ? You would hate it . It 's a bunch of my dorky high school friends . Do our code . No bullshit . I thought we weren 't gonna be that couple . Okay , bye . Hey , I' ve been thinking . Yeah ? Something positive . Maybe it 's time . Now is literally the worst time . It would be a new start for us . And for me , I would have a real purpose here . A child is not a hobby . Not a hobby . An inspiration . We could have had this fight four hours ago . I 'm late . I didn 't know it was gonna be a fight . You really wanna be the couple that has a baby to save their marriage ? Save ? Reboot , retool , rekindle , whatever ! And you 're gonna walk out the door now ? Yeah ! You 're a fucking coward . No , it can 't go on like this . Really ? I won 't . You won 't ? You won 't ? Why , it 's not good enough for you ? It 's not even close ! You stupid bitch ! What scared me wasn 't that he 'd pushed me . What scared me was how much he wanted to hurt me more . What scared me was that I 'd finally realized ... I am frightened of my own husband . You want me to call for backup ? Nah , I' ll protect you . Jesus . They ought to burn this place down . Seems like folks are trying . You really think this is anything ? Cross it off the list . Hey , Jason . What 's up , Rhonda ? ... and dedicated to the proposition that all men ... Have you seen this girl around here ? Why do you ask ? She was reported missing . ... and so dedicated , can long endure . Yeah . I remember her . What did she want ? Weed , pills ? She wanted a gun . I told her it 's not my thing . I felt bad , though . She seemed really desperate . She said it needed to be small , so she could keep it close . Are you sure this is her ? You don 't forget a girl like that in here . She was all in pink . It was Valentine 's day . For Valentine 's day , I thought I 'd buy a gun . That is how crazy I' ve become . Nick wants me gone but he won 't ask for a divorce . In his mind , I 'm the owner of his bar , his only line of credit . The bitch with the prenup . I could go home to my parents ... But I 'd have to tell them the truth . And I don 't even know if I believe the truth . Can I really think Nick would hurt me ? I 'm being paranoid . Crazy . It 's just ... I 'd sleep better with a gun . Oh , shit . Wake up , baby . My sister 's gonna come out here . Sorry to rush you . It 's okay . Here . Let me help you . Okay . Just get that . Be very careful . I 'm all right . Here you go . Promise me we 'll talk every day . Okay , we will . Every day , Nick , or I' ll go crazy . Don 't go crazy . Okay . You fucking idiot . You fucking asshole ! You fucking lied to my fucking face ! I 'm sorry . How old is she ? She 's in her early 20s . How long ? A year and a half . You lied to me for over a year ? If I told you , you would have made me stop . It 's so fucking small . You 're a liar and a cheat ! You 're just like dad ! How did you even meet her ? She 's one of my students . I thought writers hated clichés . I 'm not a writer . Boo hoo , I got laid off . I guess I' ll fuck a teenager . It wasn 't like that , okay ? You have no idea how shitty it was with Amy ... How fucking terrible she made me feel . Flyover boy . I would get knots in my stomach ... Just coming home , knowing she would be sitting there ... Dissatisfied , before I even walked in the fucking door . This is so bad . If anybody finds out , you 're totally fucked . Boney found a pair of panties in my office ... Where , occasionally , Andie and I ... I don 't know what the fuck it means . Are they super twat 's ? Her name is Andie . She 's not entirely sure . So we are dealing with a 20 year old ... Who isn 't sure where she leaves her undies ? If they 're not Andie 's , that means that they 're Amy´s ... And she left them there for me to find . Nick , I was scared for you before , and now , I 'm fucking petrified . We 're having a vigil tonight for your missing wife ... And this morning , you 're kissing your college girlfriend goodbye ! Can you imagine ? Have you watched television lately ? Cable news is all over your shit . I mean , what is wrong with this barkeep ? His wife 's nowhere to be found ... And here 's Nick dunne for you , flirting . Cute pic , huh ? Who is that ? Some fucking tragedy groupie . Who the fuck is that ? I don 't know . She was trying to give me a casserole . On the show today we have defense attorney , Tanner bolt ... Patron Saint to wife killers everywhere . Tanner bolt , would you actually consider defending Nick dunne ? Well , let me just say ... As always , Ellen , thank you for such a warm welcome . But of course , I 'd defend Nick dunne . Listen , just because this guy isn 't walking around weeping ... That doesn 't mean that he 's not hurting . Tanner , the hallmark of a sociopath is a lack of empathy . But the truth is , you 'd have to be a sociopath ... To behave normally in this situation ... Because it 's the most abnormal situation in the world . Tanner , are you trying to tell me that this photo ... Is remotely in the realm of acceptable behavior ? I 'm so sick of being picked apart by women . You need to hire Tanner bolt . I don 't deserve this . Innocent until proven guilty . That 's exactly what you deserve . Go home , Nick . Hey , buddy . I can 't believe we haven 't arrested this guy . We 're not gonna arrest anybody ... Just because some blonde dunce says so . Why are you going so easy on him ? You got a crush ? One , I am conducting an investigation , not a witch hunt . And , two , don 't talk to me that way , ever . She was trying to buy a gun . We don 't know who or what was scaring her , gil . Give me the update . No drug angles panned out yet , so cross that off the list . I talked to the nurses who care for Nick 's father . The guy 's a bastard , but he 's weak as a kitten , so cross that off the list . Hey . Hey . So , luminol lit up the kitchen like the 4th of July . Whoa . Yeah . The blood is profuse . It is Amy 's , type b , and we should have DNA soon . Thoughts on a weapon ? Trajectory indicates blunt force . Maybe a club or a two by four . She fell there , but I doubt she got back up . Amy 's medical records come in ? No , we 'll have them later tonight . My wife says he 's a killer . Well , if Tiffany says ... Hey . Hey . Thank you all for coming out . Hey Donnie , how are you ? Rich , thank you so much . Hey . Thank you , folks . Thank you for being here tonight . It just means the world to our family . And to Amy . As you all know ... My wife , Amy elliott dunne ... Disappeared three days ago . And I want to implore anyone who has any information at all ... Please come forward . Help us . So hot . He is so creepy . I wanna say something , because I think some of you might be wondering ... And are too polite to ask . I had nothing to do with the disappearance of my wife . I 'm cooperating with the police . I haven 't hired a lawyer . I have nothing to hide . Amy is my soul mate . She is brilliant ... She 's charming , and wise . I love you , Amy . Asshole . I love my wife ... So much . And I may not behave for the cameras the way they want me to ... And if they wanna punish me for that , that 's okay . But I just wanna ask you in the media , please , harass me ... But don 't harass the people of this town . If you need to mock somebody , mock me . Nick ! But please don 't turn this investigation into a circus . Where 's your wife , Nick ? Let the police do their jobs . What did you do to your pregnant wife ? Did you tell them that , Nick ? Did you tell them Amy was six weeks pregnant ? Thank you for your support tonight . Let 's find Amy . Go ahead , if you guys wanna say something . Gil , go , go . Nick , where are you going ? Stop him ! No questions right now . Thank you . Why are you running away ? Don 't run . Everybody , stay back . Guys , come on . You know better . Get off the grass , get down to the curb . Hey , gil ... On it . All right . All right , y' all heard her . No pictures . Hello ? Hello ? Fuck . You scared me . Want a drink ? Did you know she was pregnant ? I told you , noelle hawthorne is fucking crazy . She doesn 't even know Amy . They look like pretty good friends to me . Look , I don 't know . But it certainly doesn 't prove that she 's pregnant . We have her medical records coming . Good . So , let 's talk while we wait . Let 's start over here . The scene of the crime . You see , we 've seen dozens of home invasions . Dozens and dozens . This area right here , it looked wrong from the second we saw it . The whole thing looked staged . Watch this . And yet , they remained upright throughout this life and death struggle ? I don 't know . What do you want me to say ? Did you do any housekeeping the day your wife went missing ? No . Because our guys did a luminol test . And I 'm sorry to tell you , but that kitchen lit up . Amy lost a lot of blood in there , Nick . A lot . Oh , my God . Yeah , and then somebody mopped it up . Wait a second . Why would they mop up the blood ... If they 're trying to stage a crime scene ? No blood and no body suggests kidnapping . It tells us , look at people outside the house . Like these homeless you keep mentioning . A pool of blood and no body suggests homicide . It tells us to look at people inside the house . Which is what we 're doing here , Nick . I see . So , how was your marriage , Nick ? Because right now , all we got is noelle . She says , not good . Gil , what do you and your wife argue about ? What pisses you off ? Money , lack thereof . Me and my ex , it 's the same . I mention that because we got a look at your finances , Nick . $117, 000 in credit card debt . What ? I pulled up some of the merchandise . There are these fun little splurges . I didn 't buy any of this stuff . I don 't even golf ! I do ! You bought great clubs . I like the robot dog . This is identity theft ! This is a felony ! We need to find out who did this ! All right . Let 's talk about life insurance . Because in April , you bumped up Amy 's life insurance ... To $1 . 2 million . Yes , I did . That was her idea . She wanted me to . You filed the paperwork . Because she told me to ! Hold on a sec . Yeah ? Okay . For sure ? All right . She was pregnant . This is insane . So , my question becomes I don 't want to talk to you again , ever ... Without a lawyer . Margo ! Hey . Just hold on a second . Let me finish . Nick ? I hear you , I hear you . I was as surprised as I know you 're upset . I had no idea she was pregnant . Listen , I thought so , too , but evidently that wasn 't you want to know the truth ? The truth is , Amy didn 't want kids . Well , I 'm as surprised as you told me you didn 't want kids . I was trying to put a good face on . Then , suddenly , you 've got a pregnant wife . That 's a problem for you . Especially when you factor in the secret teenage girlfriend . Oh , stop watching Ellen abbott ! You have to fucking talk to me ! I didn 't tell you that she didn 't want kids because she didn 't want me to . Because it would have just been another reason for you to hate her . And we had enough of those already ! It was easier to just lie to me ? I wanted kids ! When we first moved here , I went to a fertility clinic ! It didn 't work ? I did my part ! Masturbate . When it came time for Amy to do her thing , all of a sudden it was like ... Well , I don 't know . Maybe . No , thanks . Now , who would believe you ? All right . This is a letter from the clinic ... Notifying me that they 're gonna destroy my sample ... Unless I contact them . So , I gave it to Amy . The next day , I saw it in the trash . But you were already with Andie by then , right ? I wanted a baby with Amy . A year ago , Amy being pregnant would have been the best thing ever ! When your poor Amy has a cold , this dessert just this is the clue you couldn 't solve . Yeah . A letter from desi . That creepy boyfriend of Amy 's ? It was the fucking rich guy who would do anything for her . It just kept hanging over my head . It was disgusting . Your prenup ? Nick , why have you kept this stuff ? It 's like a little box of hate . I don 't know , go ! Maybe I hate her ! I love you no matter what . But you need to tell me . Tell you what ? What are you asking me ? Are you asking me if I killed my wife , go ? Is that what you 're asking me ? If I murdered my wife ? I would never ask you that ! Margo ! Don 't walk on the glass . You have no clue , do you ? Why was he here that night ? His wife is missing . Why come here ? Who cares ? Rhonda , we got this . Let 's make the arrest . Do you know how hard it is to make a murder case without a body ? No . Well , it 's incredibly hard . So , I want one last thing . What 's that ? I want a body . Picture me . I 'm a girl who 's very , very bad . Be careful . I need to be punished , and by punished , I mean had . Fuck . It 's where you keep goodies for anniversary five . So , open the door ... Punish . Wood . Beach . ... and look alive . Punish . Wood . Wood . I will practice believing my husband loves me ... And will love this baby . That this child might really save our marriage . But I could be wrong . Because sometimes ... The way he looks at me ... I think ... Man of my dreams ... Father of my child ... This man of mine may kill me . He may truly ... Kill me . Wtf ? I am so much happier now that I 'm dead . Technically , missing . Soon to be presumed dead . Gone . And my lazy , lying , cheating , oblivious husband ... Will go to prison for my murder . Nick dunne took my pride and my dignity ... And my hope and my money . He took and took from me until I no longer existed . That 's murder . Let the punishment fit the crime . To fake a convincing murder , you have to have discipline . You befriend a local idiot . Harvest the details of her humdrum life . And cram her with stories about your husband 's violent temper . Secretly create some money troubles . Credit cards , perhaps online gambling . With the help of the unwitting ... Bump up your life insurance . Purchase getaway car . Craigslist . Generic . Cheap . Pay cash . You need to package yourself so that people will truly mourn your loss . And America loves pregnant women . As if it 's so hard to spread your legs . You know what 's hard ? Faking a pregnancy . First , drain your toilet . Invite pregnant idiot into your home ... And ply her with lemonade . Steal pregnant idiot 's urine . Voilà . A pregnancy is now part of your legal medical record . Happy anniversary . Wait for your clueless husband ... To start his day . Off he goes . And the clock is ticking . Meticulously stage your crime scene ... With just enough mistakes to raise the specter of doubt . You need to bleed . A lot . A lot , a lot . A head wound kind of bleed . A crime scene kind of bleed . You need to clean poorly ... Like he would . Clean and bleed . Bleed and clean . And leave a little something behind . A fire in July ? And because you 're you ... You don 't stop there . You need a diary . Minimum , 300 entries on the Nick and Amy story . Start with the fairy tale early days . Those are true . And they 're crucial . You want Nick and Amy to be likeable . After that , you invent . The spending . The abuse . The fear . The threat of violence . And Nick thought he was the writer . Burn it just the right amount . Make sure the cops will find it . Finally , honor tradition with a very special treasure hunt . And if I get everything right , the world will hate Nick ... For killing his beautiful , pregnant wife . And after all the outrage , when I 'm ready ... I' ll go out on the water with a handful of pills ... And a pocket full of stones . And when they find my body , they 'll know ... Nick dunne dumped his beloved like garbage . And she floated down past all the other ... Abused , unwanted , inconvenient women . Then , Nick will die , too . Nick and Amy will be gone . But , then , we never really existed . Nick loved a girl I was pretending to be . Cool girl . Men always use that as their defining compliment . She 's a cool girl . Cool girl is hot . Cool girl is game . Cool girl is fun . Cool girl never gets angry at her man . She only smiles in a chagrined , loving manner ... And then presents her mouth for fucking . She likes what he likes . So evidently , he 's a vinyl hipster who loves fetish manga . If he likes girls gone wild , she 's a mall babe ... Who talks football and endures buffalo wings at Hooters . When I met Nick dunne , I knew he wanted cool girl . And for him , I' ll admit , I was willing to try . I wax stripped my pussy raw . I drank canned beer watching Adam sandler movies . I ate cold pizza and remained a size two . I blew him semi regularly . I lived in the moment . I was fucking game . I can 't say I didn 't enjoy some of it . Nick teased out of me things I didn 't know existed . A lightness , a humor , an ease . But I made him smarter . Sharper . I inspired him to rise to my level . I forged the man of my dreams . We were happy pretending to be other people . We were the happiest couple we knew . And what 's the point of being together if you 're not the happiest ? But Nick got lazy . He became someone I did not agree to marry . He actually expected me to love him unconditionally . Then he dragged me , penniless , to the navel of this great country ... And found himself a newer , younger , bouncier ... Cool girl . You think I 'd let him destroy me and end up happier than ever ? No fucking way . He doesn 't get to win . My cute , charming , salt of the earth , Missouri guy . He needed to learn . Grown ups work for things . Grown ups pay . Grown ups suffer consequences . Wait . I need 20 seconds where you don 't judge me , interrupt me ... Or get angry . Okay . Is that all the stuff from the credit cards ? Where do you store goodies for anniversary five ? Wood . Woodshed . Yeah , my woodshed . That fucking bitch . I thought it 's all right . I would have , too . What 's that present ? I don 't know . Let 's find out . Dear husband , I know you think you 're moving through this world unseen . Don 't believe that for a second . I know where you 've been , and I know where you 're going . For this anniversary , I' ve arranged a trip . Follow the river , up , up , up . Sit back and relax , because you are done . What 's up , up river ? Up the river . Prison . Fucking crazy bitch . That 's what this is . She 's framing me for her murder . You married a complete psychopath . The morning of our anniversary ... I was gonna ask her for a divorce . I just couldn 't do it . I couldn 't fake it for another year , another day . Then what happened ? Before I could say anything , she said ... I need you to go somewhere and really think about our marriage . She knew I would go to Sawyer beach . So you 'd have no alibi . She stage managed me . She knew exactly what I would do . And I fucking did it . I went to the beach , I thought about our marriage . I came back and decided I wanted a divorce . And by the time you got home she was gone . You fuck ! She 's good . Part of me was relieved ... When I thought she was gone . Punch and Judy puppets . Remember , he beats Judy to death and kills that baby . So I 'm punch . We already knew that , Amy , what 's your point ? Does Missouri have the death penalty ? Hey , neighbor . It 's been weeks since I had anyone decent next door . Well , I don 't know how decent I feel . As long as you don 't own a python and blast death metal at 4 am ... We 're gonna be best friends . All right . Nice meeting you . I 'm greta . I 'm Nancy . Are you going to the marina ? I could use some creamer . I 'm sorry . I can 't . I' ve got work to do . All right . See you around ! You will . Come on . Show me that darling Nicky smile . You asshole . Hey . Nancy . Nancy . It 's hot again today . So , where are you from ? Let me guess . Nebraska . New Orleans . You know , I am an expert oiler . Oh , I just bet you are . Lotions and balms . Ointment . I would hate for y' all to get tan lines . So sweet . Okay . You know where I' ll be . I see we have the same taste in men . I clipped it on a bathroom cabinet . Least you could do is not keep his secrets for him . Let me guess . He 's trying to watch the big game and you just won 't shut up . No , you don 't seem like much of a talker . I got it . You caught your boy rubbing up on some hot little skank ... And he apologized to you by busting you a good one . Worse . Worse ? I went to the bar where he works to surprise him . And out he comes with this girl who had no business being in a bar . On the very first night that we met ... We walked by a bakery that was having their sugar delivered . And it was in the air , everywhere . A sugar storm . And before he kissed me ... He leaned in ... And did this . And guess what . What ? He did the exact same thing with her . That is the most disgusting thing I ever heard . Thank you . Thanks very much . Well , we 've gone mainstream . It 's an appeals process , so we will attempt to appeal to them . Mr . bolt . Tanner bolt ? Nick dunne . I have been sitting by the phone , my friend . I 'm sorry . Do you not believe me ? No , I believe you . It 's just the craziest thing I' ve ever heard . I love it . But , for you , it sucks . But you gotta have a grudging respect for your wife at this point , right ? Are you laughing me out of the building ? No ! Are you kidding me ? I 'm in . I 'm way in . You came to the right guy . This is what I do , Nick . This is why I have a $100, 000 retainer . I win the unwinnable cases . $100, 000 ? We 'll figure something out . I' ll give you a special ... My wife is skilled in the art of vengeance rate . Okay . So , what 's the plan ? Well , right now , it 's a he said , she said . She 's telling a better story . No , Nick . She is telling the perfect story . So , we need to start today to prepare your defense , should we need it . And if we decide to go with your version of the truth . Then we 'll need to realign the public 's perception of Amy . Make them stop seeing her as America 's sweetheart ... And see her for what she is , which a mind fucker of the first degree . Now , that is a huge realignment . We 'll need other voices besides yours . There has to be someone out there that she 's screwed with in the past . There 's a New York guy . O' Hara , Tommy O' Hara . Eight years ago , she pressed charges against him . That should be easy to find . Ex classmate , desi collings . She said that he stalked her . He 's in St . Louis . You go talk to Tommy , and I' ll draw up the contract . I told you , you came to the right guy . Apparently . Tommy ? Yeah . Thanks for seeing me . Yeah , yeah , yeah . You 're gonna want a drink . Yeah . So , she said you got physical with her . No , dude , she said I raped her . First degree , felony rape . Did you do it ? Did you do it ? I was looking at 30 years to life . Did you get a trial ? Fuck , no . Do I look like I would do well in the yard ? I pled down , man . Sexual assault one , no jail time . That 's something . Oh , yeah . I' ve been unemployed for the last eight years ... Because I have to write sexual offender on every job application . I 'm on a neighborhood watch list , because I have to register as a predator . I haven 't had a date in almost a decade , because if a girl googles me ... Could you walk me through what happened ? I meet Amy at this party , you know ? We click . She 's perfect . She 's beautiful , she 's smart , she 's well read ... She 's got an ass like a 20 year old stripper . I think , what 's the catch ? A few months , it hits me . This is not going to be easy . Girls like a fixer upper , but Amy ? She annexed me . She made me her business . It was just too much . She went out and bought me ties . And we must have gone 20 rounds over that . Ties . The whole thing just became so , you broke up with her . No , I just backed away . Gave her some space . No big deal , right ? So I thought . Then one night , Amy comes over to my place ... With a bottle of bourbon and a bootleg of this band I love . And within two minutes , she 's got my pants around my ankles ... And she is kneeling down , and I 'm sorry . I know it 's your wife . You had sex ? Yeah , consensual . It was rough , but she was screaming for it . Next morning , there 's two cops at my door . Amy has wounds that are consistent with rape . Ligature marks on her wrist , and my semen . It looks like I' ve tied Amy to my bed , and raped her . Me ! And then , guess what they find . Headboards of my bed , one on each side . The ties you wouldn 't wear . You do know your wife . Did you ever see her again ? Yeah . On TV , last week , with you . I thought , there 's Amy . She 's graduated from being raped to being murdered . You been watching this , too ? Last night 's bombshell . We just found out ... Amy elliott dunne was , indeed , pregnant when she went missing . Kelly capitono , this makes me wanna throw up . What is it about a pregnant woman , a woman carrying life inside her ... That turns men into animals ? Ellen , this is an epidemic . The third leading cause of death among pregnant women ... Is homicide committed by a boyfriend or husband . Let 's not forget about the wife , ever . Tonight , we welcome Amy 's best friend , noelle hawthorne . Thanks for being on the show , noelle . Thank you , Ellen . And let me just say this ... Amy would have loved you , and all you do for women . Oh , that 's nice . Why don 't you tell us about your friend , noelle ? Amy was so nurturing . Oh , I 'd love if just once , someone was like ... She was a real rag . She was beautiful and smart and kind . Seems like a rich bitch to me . What do you mean ? People love her . I don 't know . She seems uppity . Spoiled rich girl , married a cheating asshole . Paid the ultimate price . The only secret was her husband . We never met Nick . He never introduced himself . Why was that , noelle ? Why do you think ? I think we know why . Because he had a violent temper . A little harsh . That 's life , baby . He knew I 'd have seen right through him . Don 't get me wrong . I 'm not saying it 's okay he killed her . I 'm just saying , there are consequences . Fuck , yeah . She was so alone . And she was so innocent . You 're a good friend , noelle . And you 're a good friend of the show . Thanks for coming on . Please tell me you landed Tanner bolt . Tanner bolt landed me . I 'm gonna try and see desi collings on my way home . And , go ... Tanner 's retainer is $100, 000 . That 's just the retainer . Listen , I' ve got $47, 000 in savings . I' ve got $2, 500 in an ira . I 'm approved for a second mortgage on the house . We will go from there . Thank you . I love you . I love you , too . Nick keeps his father , who has Alzheimer 's , in a facility . Number of times he visited last year ? One . Oh , fuck ! His twin sister , margo , well , she is a peach . These two spend their days in the bar Amy bought them . Playing what , Lauren ? Playing house ? What the fuck ? Twin siblings often enable and abet . While I never examined Nick , or his sister ... They both seem very , very close . It 's twin cest . Disturbingly close , Lauren . And so , we close with a question . What kind of moral rot ... Allows a beautiful , talented , kind , smart , loving mother ... To vanish without the heavens hearing our outraged cries ? Can I bum a cigarette ? Amy elliott dunne , we care about you , and we will not forget . And you know what else we won 't forget ? Missouri has the death penalty . Amen . I 'd like to report some strange activity ... Near the woodshed on the property of one margo dunne . Hey . Mr . dunne . Mr . collings . I know you . I saw you at the volunteer center . I wanted to help . I hope you don 't mind me coming by . I got your address from this letter that you wrote my wife . Amy and I believe in the lost art of letter writing . I always wondered why you kept in touch after ... Everything . You were together for two years in boarding school , right ? She was my first serious girlfriend . Why did you break up ? That 's a strange question . Did you treat her bad ? Did you cheat on her ? That 's a rude question . Let me tell you what Amy told me . She dumped you , you completely unraveled . You stalked her , you threatened her ... And you attempted suicide in her bed and were institutionalized . Your wife is missing , and you came all this way to tell me this ? I thought there might be another side to this story . Mr . collings . Fuck . ... the missing persons case of Amy elliott dunne . She is the beautiful blonde inspiration for the amazing Amy kids´ book series . You 're reading that diary again ? You know how it ends . It interests me . Hey , Rhonda . He 's gonna kill me . The end . Why did he go to his dad 's house to burn it ? It 's private . There 's no one there . Why didn 't he make sure it actually burned ? Because he tripped the alarm . You were up his ass with a flashlight . The whole thing just feels hinky . Like finding an envelope marked clue . You ever hear the expression ... The simplest answer is often the correct one ? Actually , I' ve never found that to be true . Good night . Good night . Hey . Elvis is in Missouri . Thank God . Come on in . First thing you have to understand about Amy , she loves to teach lessons . Play God . Yeah , old testament God . Okay . Keep talking . She finds out I' ve been cheating on her with Andie ... Decides to teach me a lesson . Fakes her own death , frames me for it . Blood in the house , credit cards , life insurance . She does the treasure hunt . Now , the treasure hunt is critical . She 's taking us on a tour of my infidelities . Rubbing my nose in it . And she leaves clue number one for the police ... Which will lead them back to my office ... Which is a place where Andie and I would often ... And she leaves a pair of red panties . Right . Racy , looks bad . Clue two . My father 's house . Another place where Andie and I would occasionally have relations . Clue three ? Woodshed . Also a location ... Oh , my God . We had limited options . A hotel . Amy would have seen the credit card bill . Put it on Andie 's credit card . Andie 's statement went right to her parents . Nick , margo , can we head over to the little brown house ? This leads us to what ? My dad 's house . Dad 's house is blue . After the divorce , when dad wasn 't coming around ... I used to pretend that he was a spy named Mr . brown , who ... For the sake of his children 's safety , had to deny their existence . You never told me that . You told her that ? We 've got incriminating red panties in your office . We 've got a showcase showdown worth of crap in your woodshed . So , what in God 's name is at your father 's house , Nick ? And be honest . I honestly have no idea . Whatever they found , I think it 's safe to assume that it 's very bad . We got a lot of uncontained issues here . Nick , do you have any idea as to what Andie 's mindset is ? We haven 't communicated since the vigil . Okay . Amy 's parents ? No , it 's ... More pressure . We got a hurt , young girlfriend who will no doubt go public at any moment . No , Andie won 't do that . She will . They always do . Don 't take it personally . Amy 's got us in an interesting bind . We need to tell the cops about Andie . Really ? Right now , Andie just gives you another motive . We need to tell the cops about the woodshed . We need to be on the front end of that . But I 'm gonna warn you as to what will happen . They 'll go after margo . They can 't do that , can they ? She 's your accomplice . She helped you hide the evidence . In all likelihood , she knows that you killed Amy . God . Well , what are we going to do ? We find Amy . No . Any other strategy is missing the point . I' ve got two ex secret service guys that are really good . I' ll put them on it . But where do they start , Nick ? Where would Amy go ? I have no idea . Are we keeping score ? Hey ! I thought we were steering clear of men for a while . He 's nice . Because he wants to fuck you . She 's still moping about her ex ? He got cheated on , too . We three are the saddest sacks in all the ozarks . I 'm not sad . I 'm angry . There you go . I almost drank myself to death when my wife left me . I was gonna kill myself . Can you believe that ? Don 't give him the pleasure . I was going to drown myself in the Gulf of Mexico ... Let myself be dinner for the great whites . Gulf is bull sharks , miss nawlins . Why should I die ? I 'm not the asshole . Please put that on a t shirt . Miss moneybags . I thought you said you were broke . That 's a fat wad . It 's mostly singles . Singles ? What are you , a stripper ? Swamp girls , or treasure chest ? We 're just teasing . Don 't they tease people down in nola ? We can expect Nick dunne 's arrest any day now . We 've got blood in the house , huge debt , an unwanted pregnancy . And we have Amy elliott dunne , missing for five days ... Crying out for justice . We 'll be right back . Tanner has a very bad idea he 's going to pitch you . Yeah ? You 're doing Sharon schieber tomorrow in St . Louis . It could go so wrong . And you are going to tell her about Andie . Nope . That sounds like a very bad idea . You haven 't heard from her in three days . This is a ticking time bomb . You 've gotta throw yourself on it . People are gonna hate me . And then , they will forgive you . A guy admitting that he 's a gigantic asshole on television ? People empathize with that . Why don 't we just put out a statement ? They need to see you . Sharon 's specials , they get 10 million viewers . She is a crusader . If she takes you on as a cause she 's going to ask real questions . I will drill you as if you were doing a deposition . What to say , what not to say . A trained monkey ? A trained monkey who doesn 't get the lethal injection . Nick , this case is about what people think of you . They need to like you . Now , you do this and you will reach millions of those people . Maybe I only need to reach one . Hello ? Hey , baby . One minute . Hey . Hey . You clearing out ? No , I 'm just cleaning up . Let us come in and say goodbye . I' ll come by before let us give you a hand . Yeah , you gotta clear everything out , here . Dorothy is a real stickler . Not even a spare hanger can you leave behind . Gotta make sure nothing 's tucked inside . A sock ... Or undies or what have you . You did a real good job . Where is the money , sweetheart ? Look under her dress . He talked you into this ? I talked him into it . The second you leave , I 'm calling the cops . Your glasses are fake . Your hair 's dyed all hamster . You say your name 's Nancy , but you don 't even answer to it half the time . You 're hiding . I don 't know why , and I don 't really care . But you ain 't gonna call the cops . And I don 't think you 've ever really been hit before . Holy shit . Sorry , but we really need the money . Next place , be more careful , okay ? There are a lot of people out there a lot worse than we are . Excuse me . You can 't sleep here . I did not kill my wife . Why don 't you try it again ? A little less wooden . I didn 't kill my wife . What are you doing ? Every time you look smug ... Or annoyed or tense , I 'm gonna hit you with a gummy bear . That 's supposed to make me less tense ? Let 's try it again . Mr . dunne , from what I understand , you and your wife had some bumps . Yeah , we had some tough years . I lost my job . You both did . We both lost our jobs . I had to move back home so we could take care of my mother ... Who was dying of cancer and my dad , who had your dad 's scorched earth . Let 's talk about your mom , how close you were . Go on . For a while , things had been building up . Built up implies that an explosion is coming . No . At a certain point , we got on the wrong track . I had a moment of weakness . Your moment was over 15 months . I disrespected my wife . And I disrespected my marriage . And I' ll always regret it . That works . Don 't be afraid to play up the dufus husband thing , Nick . I was an idiot . I 'm a fuck up . Everything I do is wrong . I know . What men are supposed to do in general . Thank you . How do you feel ? I feel good . Go , can you pass me that box , please ? It 's Amy´s 33rd birthday present to me . You hate that watch . No , go . I love that watch . Just like I love this tie . Just like I love my wife . It 's you ! It 's you . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Good God . Last week ... I threatened to leave , and he said he 'd find me and he 'd kill me . So , I disappeared . I lost the baby . I couldn 't even tell my parents . I 'm so ashamed and I 'm so afraid . Well , he is looking for you . He showed up on my doorstep three days ago . He tracked me from my letters to you . You saved them . Knowing you were out there ... Was the only thing that 's kept me going these past few years . Let 's go to the police . You can explain everything . No , I can 't turn up now . I 'd be a pariah . Everyone would hate me . Is it wrong to want Nick to go to prison ? He should go to prison for what he 's done . I 'm setting you up at my lake house . It 's utterly secluded . Why are you so good to me ? You know why . Excuse me . I know you , don 't I ? No . You 're one of the nolan girls , right ? No , we 're from winnipeg . Excuse us . We should leave . Just a second . That was boney . I' ll call her later . Tanner . Nice to see you . Sharon ! Hi . Hope this is worth my while . You 're gonna be very happy . Sharon . Ms . schieber . Thank you so much for doing this . Can I get you anything to drink or eat before we get started ? No , I had some gummy bears . What the fuck ? I 'm sorry ? We have a major shocking development in the amazing Amy disappearance . We go live to that story now . Oh , my God . You little slut . My name is Andie Fitzgerald . I met Nicholas dunne ... When he was my creative writing teacher at mill valley . Why is she dressed like a babysitter ? I am deeply ashamed ... Of having been romantically involved with a married man . The girl with the giant cum on me tits . I truly believed we were in love . Now , she looks like a fucking mennonite . I know that is no excuse . No , it is not . I do not , in my heart , believe Nick dunne would have killed for me . My prayers go out to everyone who loves Amy . I apologize for the pain this has caused them . We have loved Nick dunne like a son . That love ended today . Come on , you 're staring at ghosts . He met our trust with lie after lie . We now absolutely believe ... Nick is involved in the disappearance of our daughter . Our amazing Amy . This just got very exciting . We need a moment . We 're gonna have to bow out of this . Nothing has changed . Everything has changed . An hour ago , we were ahead of this . Now ? I can handle this . We 're on the defense . This is a completely different dynamic . I can handle it . She 's going to eat you alive . Just trust me . Okay . Great . Mic him . One , two , three , four , five . Thank you . He shouldn 't smile at the makeup artist . Yeah , no kidding . Roll tape . Five ... four ... Three ... two ... Seriously , I can 't believe how fucking good you were . Amy brings out the best in me . Don 't . Keep it together , you two . At least for the next 24 hours . People still hate you . Women want to scratch your eyes out . Andie was really good TV . She 's a good person . Therein lies the problem . Ride this out ... And when Sharon airs tomorrow , we 'll be looking at a whole new you . But , until then ... Don 't show your face . No problem . Welcome . Make yourself at home . I' ve got music , satellite ... Netflix . He was her teacher ! Roku . Internet , obviously . Here is a supposedly grown man if there is ever anything you have a taste for and you can 't find it ... Just let me know and I will get it for you . Instead of the a b c 's , he taught her the birds and the bees . And just think how her mother must feel at a time like this . Wine cellar 's downstairs . I' ll get you some clothes , too . Not that I don 't appreciate bait shop chic . The floors are heated , just dial to your liking . There 's robes and towels . The shower has steam . The bathtub has a massage cycle . There 's a great view , if you 're in the mood . Blackout curtains if you 're not . The bed is savoir . You 'll never get a better sleep . This is just what I need . I 'm so exhausted . I' ll leave you to it , then . Amy , I am so happy that you are here . And I don 't want you to worry for one moment . There are cameras everywhere . The exterior , all along the grounds , the entryway . Anyone ... Who is caught coming or going ... Will be recorded . You are more than safe . And I am not letting you get away again . Good morning ! Don 't do that ! I 'm sorry . I need to feel safe . You are very safe . What have you been up to ? Nothing . Amy , I 'm not Nick . It 's hard for me . After so many years under someone 's thumb ... I know just what that feels like . You were never under my thumb . On your leash . Never . A new start . Decent clothes . Hair dye . Makeup . Tweezers . There 's a gym overlooking the lake . The sooner you look like yourself , the sooner you 'll feel like yourself . I' ll get groceries for tonight , we 'll watch Sharon schieber , and finally move on . I think that 's something I should watch on my own . Nonsense . I' ll be back . And I am looking forward ... To my reunion with Amy elliott . Great . Good evening , I 'm Sharon schieber . Tonight , exclusively ... Hurry up . A husband breaks his silence , not just on his wife 's disappearance ... But on his infidelity , and all those shocking rumors . Nick dunne ... You 're probably the most hated man in America right now . I probably am . And I probably deserve it . I bought that tie . Did you kill your wife , Nick ? I did not kill my wife . I am not a murderer . But you were unfaithful . I was unfaithful . And I am deeply ashamed . And , on top of that , you allowed Amy 's parents ... Her friends , all the people in your hometown ... Believe you were a loving husband , desperate to find his missing wife . Well , I am desperate to find my missing wife . You say that , but I 'm wondering how you expect us to believe you ... Now that we know you 're a liar . I didn 't come forward with my affair ... Because I knew it would make me look really , really bad . But I don 't care about that anymore . I just want to find my wife . I 'm just trying to get clear let me be clear . Just because I am not a murderer doesn 't make me a good guy . I 'm not a good guy . I was a bad husband to a great wife . I broke the vow that I made to her . Those are pretty words , Nick . But what does that really mean to you ? It basically means that I was a con artist . I met Amy elliott seven years ago . I was completely transfixed . Amy can do that to you . I was this average guy from an average place ... With mediocre aspirations . And I met a woman who dazzled me . And I wanted her to love me ... So I pretended to be better than I was . When we got married , I promised to be that guy . That guy who works harder . That guy who , who lives and acts ... And loves with as much passion as she does . But I failed her . Instead of doing what was right ... I did what was easy . You talk like a man who believes he can make amends to his wife . Who believes his wife is still alive . She is still alive . Will you look at that camera for me ? Will you look in the lens ... And talk to your wife ? If she is out there , able to hear and see you tonight ... What would you like to say to her , Nick ? Amy , I love you . You 're the best person I' ve ever known . And I' ve taken myself to the woodshed for the way that I' ve treated you . And if you come back , I promise ... I will spend every day making it up to you . I will be the man that I promised you I would be . I love you . Come home . Here . Regardless of what you thought ... What does it say ? ... I think we can all agree ... Oh , my God . You fucking killed it . ... there 's more to him than meets the eye . They 're going crazy for you . They disliked me , they liked me , they hated me . And now they love me . ... a candor and an honesty that 's worthy of respect . He 's certainly earned mine . What is it ? I 'm Sharon schieber . Good night . Margo dunne , this is a search warrant for your property . I usually ignore tipline calls ... But a neighbor was concerned about a strange man around your woodshed . Call Tanner . Okay . Fuck ! Girlfriend 's real cute , Nick . Is that what this is about ? I have treated you more than fair throughout this entire investigation . I gave you the benefit of the doubt over and over . Every time you said something stupid ... I thought , maybe he 's just stupid . But I was wrong . That 's what this is about . Are these the clubs you don 't play golf with ? None of that is mine . None of this was put here by me . Those are nice clubs . You got the makings of a real man cave . Everything just waiting until the wife goes away for good . Nick ! You can 't do that ! Of course we can . Amy , it 's time to move on . What can I do to help ? I need some time to think . That 's the last thing you need . Desi twenty years , you have kept me dangling . Finally , last night , you came to me , and you chose me . Follow that instinct . Don 't trust the instinct that left you beaten and homeless ... Sleeping in your car , fearing for your life . I 'm not gonna force myself on you . I understand what you 're saying , desi . I do . I' ve been so mistreated for so long . I' ve forgotten how to behave . I' ll move in here tomorrow ... And we 'll work it out together . I just want you to be you again . They only took margo to fuck with you . She 's not spending another fucking second in there . I 'm gonna go in , and I 'm gonna tell them everything . What ? We tell boney very little . Without a body , without a murder weapon ... Their only hope is a confession . So , you let them do all the talking . That way , we can jump start your defense . The truth is my defense . Recognize these ? Yes . It 's Amy´s anniversary present to me . Was that how she told you she was pregnant , Nick ? Mommy , daddy , baby , and that made you real mad ? No . Recognize this ? Never seen that before in my life . It 's Amy´s diary . We found this at your father 's house . Is this your wife 's handwriting ? He 's not a handwriting ex looks like it . Our experts thought so , too . Do you wanna play a little true or false ? Sure . And then he brushes the sugar off my lips so he can taste me . Yeah , that 's true . You thought quinoa was a fish ? That is also true , yes . She wanted to get pregnant , you assaulted her . I hit her ? No , never happened . Pushed , it says pushed . Absolutely not . I never touched her . She tried to buy a gun . I doubt that , but I don 't know . Shall I read the last entry ? Sure . This man may kill me . In her own words , this man may kill me . It 's kind of a convenient end note . For future reference ... The truth , you are not a handwriting expert . Okay , I know . Judy 's missing handle . Big as a two by four , right ? Big as a club . We found this day one , in the fireplace in your home office . We didn 't know what the hell it was , but fire in July ? We bagged it . I' ve never seen that before either . We just tested it . Fire doesn 't erase blood , Nick . So , finally , Nicholas dunne ... You 're under arrest for the murder of your wife . Do not say another word . What about my side ? Nick ! More coffee ? I 'd love it . Remember that time we skipped school and drove to the cape ? God , yeah . Lobster right from the ocean . This reminds me of that . Never ending holiday . You 're not bored ? Desi , how could I be bored ? You can discuss 18th century symphonies ... 19th century impressionists , quote proust in French . Nick 's idea of culture was a reality TV marathon ... With one hand down his boxers . I really have to get going . But I will be back just as soon as I can . My keys . Thank you . That 's how the kids wear it . Dunne ? You got one hell of a lawyer . Hey . Are you okay ? Yes . Are you ? Yeah . Let 's go . What does this mean ? Well , you 're out on bond . You can relax at home while we prep for trial . Keep your head down . Tanner , is there any fucking lead on Amy ? I' ve got two of my best guys on it . She 's air . Come home , Amy . I dare you . Mr . collings is home . Hello , Mr . collings . I' ve missed you . I' ve been thinking ... I don 't wanna be without you . Stay with me . And when all this dies down , we 'll go to Greece , like you said . Octopus and scrabble ? How long do you think until it 's done ? Not long . Six months for the trial . Sentencing will be quick . He 'll appeal . I can watch the rest overseas . Go slowly . But I want it . Don 't rush . Just do it . Harder . You fucking bitch . Don 't you worry , you 're gonna have lots of babies . Her wounds are consistent with rape . There was semen present . We 'll make sure it 's a match . Yeah , it 'll match . Thank you very much . What do you think ? Are we pals again ? Now that I know you didn 't murder your wife , yes . What do you think ? Kidnapping ? The story 's insane . She 's on fairly heavy painkillers . It 's okay . I want to help . Ms . dunne , I know what you 've been through ... So we 'll keep this very brief . Can you walk us through what happened ? That morning , the doorbell rang . So normal . I opened the door . So strange . Since high school , he won 't ever go away . And I' ve just tried to be nice to him . Answer his letters . Keep him calm . Oh , my God . I' ve encouraged him . You can 't blame yourself . He pushed inside . And he grabbed me . But I got away , and ran to the kitchen . And he clubbed me . I collapsed . That club was actually the handle to a punch and Judy puppet . Right . Treasure hunt . I 'd hidden some puppets at go 's then how did desi have that handle ? I 'd just found it . It must have fallen off . I was holding it when desi pushed in . So , he got it from me . About that woodshed ... He took me to his lake house . Tied me to his bed . Back to the woodshed real quick . Real quick . When you went to place the puppets there ... Did you notice that it was packed lots of stuff . Corresponding to purchases made on credit cards in your husband 's name . Nick and credit cards . He buys , I nag . I don 't know , probably . He hid a lot of stuff at go 's . They 're very close . Now , may I go back to where I was being held prisoner ... By a man with a history of mental problems ? Please continue , Ms . dunne . Desi assaulted me that night . Every night . He tied me up like a dog . And then , he 'd punish me . Starve me . Shave me . Sodomize me . There were cameras everywhere . Please find this . Please find the tapes . She slit his throat with a box cutter . How did she manage to get a hold of a box cutter ... If he had her tied up the whole time ? Can 't you just be happy your wife is home and safe ? Amy , we found your diary . It contains many concerning allegations of mental and physical abuse . Well , it 's the ugly truth . Nick didn 't want a baby . He has a temper . We had money problems . But I love him . Then why did you try to buy a gun ? I 'm sorry , I feel myself fading . If I could just clarify one thing if this case had been left in your deeply incompetent hands ... My husband would be on death row ... And I 'd be tied , still , spread eagle ... Ms . dunne , you 've been very brave . We 're finished . Now , I have to ask you ... Do you feel safe going home with your husband ? We prayed to God , and God has answered our prayers . Amy dunne is home . Now , I know there are a lot of questions and concerns ... But for right now , we wanna sit tight ... And just be thankful and grateful for this miracle on the Mississippi . Excuse me . Excuse us , folks . We love you , Amy ! All right , you can stop pretending now . I 'm not pretending . You were perfect . The Nick I saw on TV , that 's the Nick I fell in love with . You do know I was just telling you what you wanted to hear , right ? That 's how well you know me . You know me in your marrow . Okay . You need to tell me exactly what happened . Take off your clothes . I need to make sure you 're not wearing a wire . You killed someone , Amy . You 're a murderer . I 'm a fighter . I fought my way back to you . You killed a guy . You slashed his throat with a box cutter . You went on national television and begged for me to save your life . And I obliged . But I want that Nick . I 'm leaving . You really think that 's smart ? Shampoo . Wounded , raped wife battles her way back to her husband ... And he deserts her . They 'll destroy you . Neighbors will shun you . And I' ll make sure that no one forgets the pain you caused me . I don 't want anything to do with your groupies outside . Once they go ... I go . Give it the night . Sleep on it . Was there ever a baby ? There can be . Good night . Hey , Nick ! Hello , handsome . Crepe ? Sure . She was his dream girl . And when this spoiled , rich , entitled little boy couldn 't have her ... He took her . You must be so proud . It 's been four hours . Nick ? Nick ? What 's next for you and Amy ? Right now , it 's all about our marriage . When two people love each other and can 't make that work ... That 's the real tragedy . Kiss my cheek . I can 't believe that fucking spider is America 's sweetheart . She told me she killed desi . Not self defense . Murder . Can 't we get a wire ? That 's not gonna work . She told you once before . Yeah , because she had me strip naked , and stand in the shower . I swear , you two are the most fucked up people I' ve ever known . And I specialize in fucked up . You and Amy under the same roof ? You should pitch that as reality television . Amy dunne , and the miracle on the Mississippi . Nick and I have been through some bad patches . We 've had our dark days . But we thank you so much ... For supporting us in our new life together , for forgiving Nick . Really , your encouragement means the world . She 's good . Amazing Amy and the humbled husband . The real housewives of branson . Take care of this guy , will you ? I can 't believe you 're just leaving now . You are not at risk anymore . I 'm the definition of at risk . You got a book deal , a lifetime movie , you franchised the bar . You may wanna thank her . Just don 't piss her off . See you , guys . Elvis has left Missouri . She had to have made a mistake . We need to check Amy 's story , piece by piece . Nick , I can 't do anything . We had the national spotlight on us , we stained the rug . The case is with the feds now , they 're done . That doesn 't mean you have to be done . It does . What are you doing ? Couldn 't sleep . Come on ... Let me tuck you back in . You know you can sleep with me , right ? Yeah , it 's just ... I need more time . I would never , ever hurt you . I do need you to participate , though . I need you to do your part . Okay . Everything you have heard about my wife ... Is a lie . She is a calculating , murderous psychopath . And I have been complicit Nick ! Nick ? Breakfast . Honey ? We should hold hands . Not the entire time , but on and off throughout . So , Nick , how does it feel to have your wife back ? It 's fantastic . How many people are lucky enough to get a second chance at love ? Fantastic is a little flippant . Amazing ? I need you to admit that you got the credit cards ... And that you hid all that stuff at go 's and that you pushed me . I 'm gonna need those three things to feel safe . You have to own this , Nick . Don 't worry . I know exactly what to say . Nick . What a beautiful home . I so appreciate you giving us this time , Nick . You went on national television ... And told people that I murdered my wife . I go where the story goes . You implied that I had carnal relations with my sister . I didn 't use the I word . I said you two were extremely close . You and a panel of nitwits diagnosed me as a sociopath . Ice breaker . To go with your robot dog . I' ll go find Amy . She 's downstairs . What is it ? It 's for you . Open it . I don 't need any more gifts from you . Open it . I didn 't touch you . You didn 't need to . Bullshit . That notice of disposal . I have that . You threw it out . The notice , yes . I want a blood test . I want a paternity test . I love tests . You can teach those people to hate me all you want . I don 't care . I am leaving you . I won 't have to teach your child to hate you . He 'll do that all by himself . You fucking cunt ! I 'm the cunt you married . The only time you liked yourself ... Was when you were trying to be someone this cunt might like . I 'm not a quitter . I 'm that cunt . I' ve killed for you . Who else can say that ? You think you would be happy with a nice midwestern girl ? No way , baby . I 'm it . Look , you 're delusional . You 're insane . Why would you even want this ? Yes , I loved you . And then all we did was resent each other , and try to control each other . And cause each other pain . That 's marriage . Now , I 'm getting ready . I can 't watch you play house with that thing for the next 18 years . I can 't just walk away . You could get custody . No , I won 't . And you know it . It 's gonna be my child . I 'm not gonna leave it . You wanna stay . I have a responsibility . It 's not about what I want anymore . You wanna stay with her . You 're breaking my heart . Go , you 're my voice of reason . I need you with me on this . Of course I 'm with you . I was with you before we were even born . We 've been through the darkness . We 've come out , united . We communicate . We 're honest with each other . Right ? We 're partners in crime . And ? And ? We 're gonna be parents . My goodness ! How exciting ! Thank you ... What are you thinking ? How are you feeling ? What have we done to each other ? What will we do ? Stand still . Eyes to the floor . Walk on . TEMPORARY DETENTION CENTER MINISTRY FOR STATE SECURITY Address him as ´Captain ! ' Enter . Sit down . Hands under your thighs , palms down . What do you have to tell us ? I' ve done nothing . I know nothing . You 've done nothing , know nothing ... You think we imprison people on a whim ? No ... If you think our humanistic system capable of such a thing , that alone would justify your arrest . We 'd like to jog your memory , prisoner no . 227 . On September 28th , Dieter Pirmasens , your friend and neighbor , fled to the West . We believe that he had help . I know nothing . He didn 't even tell me he wanted to leave . I first heard about it at work . Please recount what you did on September 28th . - It 's in my statement . - Tell me again . I was at Treptow Park memorial with my children . Where I met my old friend Max Kirchner . We went to his place and listened to music until late . He has a telephone , you can call him to confirm this . I can give you the number . The enemies of our state are arrogant . Remember that . It takes patience . About 40 hours worth . ( STASI COLLEGE , POTSDAM- EICHE ) Fast forward ... I want to sleep . Please , let me sleep ! Hands under your thighs . Tell me again what you did on September 28th . Please , just one hour , just a little ... a little sleep . Tell me again what you did on that day . Why keep him awake for so long ? It 's ... inhuman . An innocent prisoner will become more angry by the hour , due to the injustice suffered . He will shout and rage . A guilty prisoner becomes more calm and quiet ... Or he cries . He knows he 's there for a reason . The best way to establish guilt or innocence is non- stop interrogation . ... school friend Max Kirchner . We went to his place ... and listened to music until late . He has a telephone , you can call him to confirm this . Do you notice anything about his statement ? It 's the same as at the beginning . Exactly the same . Word for word . People who tell the truth can re- formulate things , and they do . A liar has prepared sentences , which he falls back on when under pressure . 227 is lying . We have two important indicators , and can increase the intensity . If you don 't give names , We 'll have to arrest your wife . Jan and Nadja will be put into state care . Is that what you want ? Who was the person who helped him flee ? - Glaske ... - Again ! Speak clearly ! Glaske ... Werner Glaske . Werner ... Glaske . Quiet ! Quiet ! Listen ! Does anyone know what that is ? It 's the odor sample for the dogs . It must be collected at every interrogation . Never forget it ! Your subjects are enemies of Socialism . Never forget that ! Goodbye . That was good , really good . You remember how we sat there 20 years ago ? They 've offered me a professorship . Life 's not about good grades , though mine weren 't that bad , thanks to you . So what 's up ? Why do you always think I 'm scheming ? - I wanted to invite you to the theater . - The theater ? I heard that Minister Hempf is going . As head of the Culture Department , I should show my face . It starts at 7 p . m . We should get going . THE LIVES OF OTHERS Minister Hempf at one o' clock . He used to be in State Security , you know . He really cleaned up the theater scene . Georg Dreyman , the writer . An arrogant type , the kind I warn my students about . But he 's loyal . If they were all like him , I 'd be out of a job . He 's our only non- subversive writer who is also read in the West . He thinks the GDR is the greatest country on earth . It starts . What 's wrong , my child ? A new vision ? Speak , Marta ! Speak ! Your Arthur ... is dead . Arthur ? Can 't you be wrong , just this once ? No , sister . Believe me . He fell to his death . Crushed by the mighty wheel . I see it , though I 'd rather see any other horror . Why am I not spared these visions ? Elena ! Go home ... and mourn . I' ll finish your shift . Did you like it ? Dreyman 's good , eh ? I 'd have him monitored . Monitored ? All that teaching is ruining your instincts . I could oversee it myself . He 's clean , I tell you . Even Hempf likes him . We 'd be shooting ourselves in the foot . I 'm going down . " Faces of Love " I hear a lot about your work . They say culture 's in good hands . Your name is mentioned in Party circles . We 're the Party 's ´shield and sword ' . I 'm aware of that at all times . What do you make of him ? Of Georg Dreyman ? Maybe ... Maybe what ? Maybe he 's not as clean as he seems . Grubitz ! That 's why you and I are on top . Your average Stasi chump would have said , " One of our best ! So loyal ! " etc . But we can see more . You 're heading to the very top , Grubitz . There 's something fishy about him . I can feel it in my gut . Dreyman 's having a party next week . Some dubious types are going , Hauser and that rabble . Try to wire the place discreetly by then . Measures A and B . Only in his rooms . Nothing conspicuous . He has powerful friends . No one is to know about this until we 've found something . But if you get something on him , you 'll have a good friend in the Central Committee . You understand what I 'm saying ? Have a nice evening , Comrade Minister . Why is he staring at us ? What 's he doing here , anyway ? I think he 's got a crush on you . I can 't let the evening pass without raising a toast to our artists . A great Socialist , I can 't recall who it was , once said : Writers are engineers of the soul . So Georg Dreyman is one of our country 's greatest engineers . - What charming bed- fellows you have . - Paul ! And to Christa- Maria Sieland , the loveliest pearl of the GDR . I believe that nobody contradict my opinion . Let 's raise our glasses to Christa- Maria Sieland : Three cheers to her . Someone like him doesn 't even deserve to address you . Stay with me ! And now something for the soul ... May I ? - How did you like my speech ? - Many thanks . I liked your play too . Really , it was good . " Engineers of the soul . " That was a Stalin quote . Really ? I , too , like to provoke , Mr . Hauser . But unlike you , I know how far I can go . I 'm more like our dear Dreyman . He knows that the Party needs artists , but that artists need the Party even more . If you 're going to talk politics , I' ll find another dance partner . - I 'm willing . - Too late ! I follow our theater with interest . It used to be theater people ... - Paul ! - It 's okay , I' ve known Mr . Hauser for years . Comrade Schwalber ! You did a good job tonight too . Dreyman , I 'm glad you 're working with such directors . It wasn 't always so . You 're referring to Jerska ? I think you judged him too harshly . Sure , he went too far in what he said . Without a doubt . But put yourself in his shoes for a moment . You , as a man of honor . He can 't remove his name from that statement . He could work for any theater in the West . But he wants to stay here . Because he believes in Socialism and in this country . - His black- listing is ... - Black- listing ? We don 't do that here ! You should choose your words more carefully . Comrade Hempf , just between us : My plays are not strong enough to survive Schwalber 's direction . I need Jerska , and I think you judged him too harshly . Well , I don 't . But that 's what we all love about your plays . Your love for mankind ... your belief that people can change . Dreyman , no matter how often you say it in your plays , people do not change ! How is he , by the way ? He hopes that his black - ... that he can work again soon . Is he right in hoping ? Of course he is . As long as he lives , and even longer . Because as you know , Dreyman , hope always dies last . The team will be ready to wire the place as of tomorrow . It needs to be finished by Thursday . You should plan everything carefully . Think you can do it ? Good night . I' ll get in trouble if I don 't go . - With who ? - My girlfriend . Twenty minutes . Yes ? Frau Meineke ... One word of this to anyone , and Masha loses her spot at the university . Is that understood ? Yes . Send Mrs . Meineke a gift for her cooperation . It must be Thursday again . Time passes so quickly ... Perhaps that 's a good thing . - How are you ? - Not bad . It 's not always this noisy . Only on Thursdays , I know . Yes . We missed you at the premiere . Did Schwalber do a good job ? His good bits were stolen from you . That keeps my ideas alive . Don 't bear it . I can 't bear those fat , dressed- up people at premieres anymore . Doesn 't sound like me , does it ? But maybe this is the real me , not the old Jerska . He was friendly and caring , nourished by success ... all thanks to the grace of the bigwigs . But I won 't complain much longer . In my next life , I' ll simply be an author . A happy author who can write whenever he wants . Like you . What is a director if he can 't direct ? He 's a projectionist without a film , a miller without corn . He is nothing . Nothing at all . Albert , the Minister was at the premiere . Minister Hempf . I spoke to him about your blacklisting . It looks promising . He gave me hope , concrete hope . Literally . Really ? That 's great . Cheap Georgian wine . Chateau Jerska . So is our holy drinker coming ? I forgot to ask him . You 're strong and forceful . That 's how I need you . Don 't let this blackness into your life . - Albert is my friend . - And you 're my boyfriend . Looks like a 50th . But I 'm going to be 40 , right ? Don 't forget , you promised to wear a tie for your birthday . I would , but I don 't have one . Bon anniversaire ! Atie ? You said you didn 't want any books . Or can 't you tie a tie , you old working- class poet ? What ? I was born wearing a tie ! I had to " fight my way out of my middle- class fetters " . Then put those fetters on again , just for me . Alright ... It 's no big deal to tie a tie . Frau Meineke , would you come in for a moment ! Can you tie a tie ? You 've no idea how thankful I am . - Are you feeling unwell ? - No ... I 'm feeling fine . Finished ? Wonderful . It 's perfect . It couldn 't be better . It 'll be our secret . You can keep a secret , right ? Of course . I' ll be damned ! And I thought you couldn 't do it . You don 't normally hide your talents . You 've no idea of the things I can do ! The first guest . Our dear neighbors locked the main door again . - Can you go ? - Yes , I 'm going . Maestro ! Our humble offerings . - I expressly said no books ! - But thanks . Would you like a drink ? - A soda . - Vodka for me . I' ll get it . Why the hell 's Albert sitting all alone ? He won 't talk to us . He sent us all away . I brought you something too . - Did you really come here to read ? - It is Brecht ! I feel like a fraud among these people . A fraud ? Come off it , Albert ! You 're losing your grip on reality . You know how we admire you , how everybody admires you . For something I did 10 years ago ... and could probably never do again . My favorite director ! Wait ! I need to talk to you a moment . Tell me again how you got into this position . Pure talent . Of course ! But what else did you have to do ? Everyone knows you 're with the Stasi ! - What an outrageous insinuation ! - Don 't forget it ! - Paul ! - What ? Excuse my friend , he 's had too much to drink . But you know he 's with the Stasi ! No , Paul . I don 't know that . You 're such an idealist that you 're almost a bigwig . It was informers and conformists like that who ruined Albert . Spy , betrayer ! If you don 't take a stand , you 're not human ! If you ever want to take action , call . If not , we don 't have to meet again . Your friends don 't have much taste . That 's really unfair . Here ! Look at this beautiful backscratcher . That 's a salad fork ! Still , it 's beautiful ... And look at this . I' ll write my new play with this . You have no taste either ! I do in some things . - It 's from Jerska . - So he did give you a book ! " Sonata for a Good Man " " ' Lazlo´ and CMS unwrap presents , then presumably have intercourse . " You 're late . Sorry , Captain . Those red lights made me lose all of four minutes . You know how it is . They 're already at it ! Unbelievable ! These artists ! They 're always at it ! That 's why I prefer monitoring artists to priests or peace activists . See you tomorrow at 11 a . m . Albert Jerska , operation ´Engerling ' . Systematic as usual , Wiesler . The files will be sent . Let 's have lunch . The BSG Volleyball team will meet at 7 p . m . Did you forget ? Bosses sit over there . Socialism must start somewhere . About the license plate of the car that brought Ms . Sieland home ... It 's Minister Hempf 's car . Wiesler , we can 't monitor top officials . I removed the entry in your report . Nothing written from now on , just oral ! So we 're helping a Committee member get a rival out of the way . You know what this could mean for my career . And for yours . If we find something ... Is that why we joined ? You remember the oath we took ? " We are the Party 's shield and sword . " What is the Party , if not its members ? And if those members are highly influential , all the better ! I' ve got a new one . Honecker comes into his office , opens the window , sees the sun , and says ... What 's wrong ? Oh , excuse me ... I just ... No , carry on , colleague ! No harm in laughing about the Party Chairman , is there . I probably know the joke anyway . Come on , tell us ! Well ... Honecker ... I mean , the Comrade General Secretary sees the sun and says , - " Good morning , dear sun ! " - More like , " Good morning , dear sun ! " The sun replies , " Good morning , dear Erich ! " And at noon , Erich goes to the window and says , " Good day , dear sun ! " The sun replies , " Good day , dear Erich ! " In the evening , Erich says again , " Good evening , dear sun ! " and the sun doesn 't reply . " Good evening , dear sun ... " " What 's wrong ? " he asks . And the sun replies , " Screw you , I 'm in the West now ! " Name ? Rank ? Department ? Me ? Stigler . 2nd Lieutenant Axel Stigler . Dept . M . I don 't have to tell you what this means for your career . Please , Comrade Lieutenant Colonel , I was just ... You were just deriding the Party ! That 's incitement , and likely just the tip of the iceberg ! I will report this to the Minister 's office . Just kidding ! Good one , huh ? But yours was good too . I know a better one though . What 's the difference between Honecker and a phone ? None at all . Hang up , try again ! - No , I have to get home . - Bye . Cold ? Christa , you forgot our meeting on Thursday . Or did your poet have two birthdays in a row ? Come on , get in . Get in ! You don 't know what 's good for you . Don 't worry . I 'm looking after you . Tell me you don 't need it too . Just say so , and I' ll let you go . I 'm meeting someone . Where do you think we 're going ? I 'm taking you to him ! You 'll be there even quicker . Time for some bitter truths . Yes ? Those idiots ! Next Thursday at the Metropol . Drive ! Christa ? Just hold me . Good evening , comrade ! You 're 5 minutes late again . Evening . 11th floor , right corridor . I 'm already up here . How did you get into the building ? A bunch of you guys live here . I don 't think I' ve been here before . No , I don 't think you have . Well ? Was that nice ? - Stay awhile . - I can 't , my next customer is at half- past . I work on a schedule . At one- thirty ? You won 't make it . Sure I will . Don 't you worry . Book me for longer next time . Bye . Georg ? Did you hear about Hauser ? No , what happened ? He can 't get a travel permit for his lectures in the West . Are you surprised ? If he acts so arrogantly , he should expect it . Would you let him go , if you were in their position ? " CMS comes home . ´Lazlo´ approves of Hauser 's foreign travel ban . " Have you seen my Brecht book ? - What ? - My Brecht book . I don 't know where it is . Strange . I could 've sworn ... One day in blue- moon September , silent under a plum tree , I held her , my silent pale love , in my arms like a fair and lovely dream . Above us in the summer skies was a cloud that caught my eye . It was white and so high up . And when I looked up , it was no longer there . - Yes ? - Georg ? Wallner here . What 's up ? Georg , it 's about Jerska . He hanged himself last night . Georg ? I 'm going to hang up , okay ? " Sonata for a Good Man " You know what Lenin said about Beethoven 's ´Appassionata ' . " If I keep listening to it , I won 't finish the revolution . " Can anyone who has heard this music , I mean truly heard it , really be a bad person ? Are you really with the Stasi ? Do you even know what the Stasi is ? Yes . They 're bad men who put people in prison , says my dad . I see . What 's the name of your ... My what ? Ball ! What 's the name of your ball ? You 're funny ! Balls don 't have names . It 's all in place , Minister . The latest technology . Behind every light switch , even in the toilet . - Measure C in the hall ... - You said you 'd find something ! Find something ! I 'd advise even my worst enemy not to disappoint me . Now get out of here ! Nowack , you 're to watch Christa- Maria . You 'll report on every minute that she 's not with me . We revoked Hauser 's travel permit for the culture conference . Maybe that 'll lead to something . The two of them are very close . How 's it going between CMS and the Minister ? They 're meeting tomorrow night , I think . That 's good ! Very good ! We have a lot to gain from this love story . Or a lot to lose . Don 't forget that . I used to be afraid of just two things : Being alone , and not being able to write . Since Albert 's death , I don 't care about writing or about other people . All I 'm afraid of now is losing you . You needn 't be afraid tonight . I 'm just going out for a few hours . Where to ? An old classmate 's in town . Really , Christa ? - Really ? - How dare you ! I know . I know where you 're going . And I 'm asking you not to go . You don 't need him . You don 't need him . I know about your medication too . And how little faith you have in your talent . Have faith in me , at least . Christa- Maria . You are a great artist . I know that . And your audience knows it too . You don 't need him . You don 't need him . Stay here . Don 't go to him . No ? Don 't I need him ? Don 't I need this whole system ? What about you ? Then you don 't need it either . Or need it even less . But you get in bed with them too . Why do you do it ? Because they can destroy you too , despite your talent and your faith . Because they decide what we play , who is to act , and who can direct . You don 't want to end up like Jerska . And neither do I . That 's why I 'm going now . You 're right about so many things , and I want to change so much . But I ask you , I implore you : Don 't go ! Well , boss , am I on time ? Let me guess what those two are doing ... Come on , I' ll take over . I don 't want you to do overtime because of me . " Don 't go through that door . " Where 's she going ? To meet an old classmate . You 'll have my detailed report tomorrow . I can manage . Good night . What are you staring at ? Soda water . No , uh ... Vodka . Double . Another one . Can I have a cognac , please ? Madam ? Go away , I want to be alone . Ms . Sieland . Do we know each other ? You don 't know me , but I know you . Many people love you for who you are . - Actors are never ´who they are . ' - You are . I' ve seen you on stage . You were more who you are ... than you are now . So you know what I 'm like . I 'm your audience . - I have to go . - Where to ? I 'm meeting an old classmate . I ... You see ? Just now you weren 't being yourself . No ? No . So you know her well , this Christa- Maria Sieland . What do you think ... Would she hurt someone who loves her above all else ? Would she sell herself for art ? For art ? You already have art . That 'd be a bad deal . You are a great artist . Don 't you know that ? And you are a good man . " When I begin my shift , ´Lazlo´ and CMS are arguing about whether CMS should meet her classmate . Eventually , she leaves . ' Lazlo´ seems unhappy about this . But after about 20 minutes , CMS returns , to ´Lazlo´s ' surprise , and mine . He seems very happy about this . Vigorous acts of intimacy follow . She says she 'll never leave again . He says repeatedly : ´Now I' ll have the strength , now I' ll do something . ' This likely refers to writing a new stage play . In recent weeks , ´Lazlo´s ' playwriting had been plagued by difficulties . What she means by her statement is unclear . Perhaps she intends to take better care of his household . The rest of the night was peaceful . " Oh , comrade ... uh ... It 's just because ... He 's sleeping too ... Good report . Really ? I didn 't know he was in such a bad way . Neither did I . " On One Who Made it to the Other Side : The statistics office on Hans Beimler Street counts everything , knows everything . How many shoes I buy a year : 2 . 3 . How many books I read a year : 3 . 2 . And how many pupils graduate with straight A 's every year : 6347 . But there is one thing they don 't count , maybe because even bureaucrats find it painful , and that 's suicides . If you call Beimler Street to ask how many people between the Elbe and the Oder , between the Baltic Sea and the Ore Mountains despair drove to their death , our numbers oracle is silent . But it may just note your name for State Security ... Those grey men who ensure safety in our land ... and happiness . In 1977 , our country stopped counting suicides . They called them ´self- murderers ' . But it has nothing to do with murder . It knows no bloodlust , no heated passion , it knows only death , the death of all hope . When we stopped counting , only one country in Europe drove more people to their death : Hungary . We came next , the land of ' Real Existing Socialism ' . One of the uncounted is Albert Jerska , the great director . It 's him I want to talk about today ... " I tried to get statistics that show ... ... that State Security operates more effectively than we think ! I foolishly rehearsed my speech for the West in here . Since then , I' ve become very musical . We can meet at my place . " 3 p . m . , Pankow Memorial " Well ? Is this safe enough ? My own ´bodyguard ' . I call him Rolf . That 's probably his name , too . Fire away . Here . You want to publish this ? In the West , with your help . Will you help ? Have you told Christa ? No . I' ll help you , as long as you don 't tell her anything . What ? Georg , it 's for her own protection . This could be right for the ´Spiegel ' . I 'm friends with an editor there . Gregor Hessenstein . Know him ? Not personally . You have to meet him . But you can 't publish using your real name . Unless your idea of fun is a 48- hour interrogation . I 'm cold ! We could go to my place ? There 's no State Security at my place ! A friend of Margot Honecker , winner of the National Award ... Second class ! My apartment is clean , I tell you ! If only we could be sure ... I have an idea how we can check your apartment . You know my uncle Frank , who visits from West Berlin every Saturday , with his big gold Mercedes . It seems a bit risky to me , Mr . Hauser . Yes , I agree with Georg . Hiding your nephew under the back seat ? I 'm really not sure . Come on , they won 't search under the seats . They 'll look under the axles , tap the exhaust , then I' ll be across . Paul too . The border guards aren 't very bright . You 've got the wrong idea there . - Which border will you cross ? - Heinrich- Heine Street . Good old Henrich Heine . They know me and my gold Mercedes . I 'm friends with the guards . Trust me , I' ll call you in 2 hours , a Schultheiss beer in my hand , and report the news : Paul 's across . No ! What about Paul 's Stasi man ? Rolf ! Rolfy , Rolfy ... He 'll think that Paul 's at home . Okay , I have to go . We wouldn 't want him to suffocate , would we ? Another beer ? Border control , Heinrich- Heine Street . Who is this ? Who is this ? No reply . Just this once , my friend . - Dreyman . - Okay , Paul 's plan worked ! No border control at all ? No , no special checks . Those boys aren 't so bad . It worked as planned . Thanks for doing this , Mr . Hauser . Forget it , it wasn 't all that dangerous . - Yeah , true . - Yeah . See you soon , and thanks a lot . Bye . What do we do if they ask what we 're doing together ? Then ... we 'll say We 'll say we 're writing a stage play together . For the GDR 's 40th anniversary . Yes ! And it 's kind of true . Who 'd have thought our State Security was so incompetent ? Who 'd have thought they were such idiots ? Just you wait ... " 7 . 32 p . m . No further noteworthy incidents . " Hello , comrade . Listen to this here ! Sure , in 1967 there were many suicides . But why in 1977 ? You must explain . You must describe the social conditions more clearly . It should remain literature , not political agitation . The text is great . I just want to be sure people understand it in the West . It 'll cause a sensation either way . - That 's Hauser ! - Of course it 's Hauser . He 's not in the West ! They 're writing a play together . For the 40th anniversary . It doesn 't sound like a play to me . No ? Then what ? I don 't know ... but not a play . You think a lot , Sergeant Leye . You 're not an intellectual , are you ? Me ? No ... I 'm not one of those . Then don 't behave like one . I chose you because you know the equipment and don 't ask questions . Leave the thinking to your superiors . Yes , Captain . I' ll be off , then . Have a nice day ... of work ... I mean , I hope you enjoy your work . Maybe I can re- write this part . I' ll send you all the material we have . Can you do it in two weeks ? Then I could run it as a cover story for the first week in March . It 's Christa . Georg ? Christa , this is Gregor Hessenstein . - Christa Sieland . - Of course , I know that ! So , what conspiracy are you cooking up ? Hauser and I are writing a play for the GDR 's 40th anniversary . Together ? The ´Spiegel´ may do an article on it . - And who 'll play the lead role ? - We planned to ask you . Christa , who would you rather play : Lenin or his dear old mother ? You can choose . I see I 'm not welcome here . I' ll go for a nap . Your caution is praiseworthy . The fewer people know , the better . The Stasi is not to be toyed with . On that note , I brought something for you . I 'd have preferred the whole pie . I already have a typewriter . The Stasi can identify its typeface . If they intercepted the text at the border , for your typewriter using , you 'd end up in Hohenschonhausen . And that 's no fun , as Paul can confirm , right ? I 'm afraid I could only get a red ink ribbon for this model . Do you mind writing it in red ? That won 't be a problem . Is there somewhere you can hide it ? - Yes , I' ll find a place . - Don 't take it lightly . I don 't want my next article to be about your disappearance ! Nobody may know that this typewriter exists ! Is this apartment really safe ? Yes . It 's the only place left in the GDR where I can say what I want . Fine , then let 's drink to that ! This is the real stuff . To you ! To letting all of Germany see the true face of the GDR ! Cheers . It 's better than the Russian stuff ! To your success ! I must see Comrade Grubitz . Tomorrow at 2 . 30 p . m ... Tell him that if he blows the cover , we 'll shut down the entire parish ! It 's easy ! He can call the Pope and complain ! Okay , I' ve spent enough time on this nonsense . Wiesler , I 'm glad you 're here . I have to show you something . " Prison Conditions for Subversive Artists Based on Character Profile . " Pretty scientific , eh ? And look at this : " Dissertation supervisor : A . Grubitz . " That 's great , isn 't it ? I only gave him a B ... They shouldn 't think getting a doctorate with me is easy . But this is first- class . Did you know that there are just 5 types of artists ? Your guy , Dreyman , is a type 4 . A " hysterical anthropocentrist . " Can 't bear being alone , always talking , needing friends . That type should never be brought to trial . They thrive on that . Temporary detention is the best way to deal with them . Complete isolation and no set release date . No human contact the whole time , not even with the guards . Good treatment , no harassment , no abuse , no scandals ... nothing they could write about later . After 10 months , we release . Suddenly . That guy won 't cause us any more trouble . Know what the best part is ? Most type 4s we 've processed in this way never write anything again ! Or paint anything , or whatever artists do ... And that without any use of force ... Just like that ! Kind of ... like a present . What brings you here ? Developments with Dreyman ? That 's why I 'm here . I think the time has come ... For what ? For us to slim down the operation . I don 't want to run day and night shifts for such an uncertain case . Uncertain , eh ? You don 't think we 'll find anything for the Minister ? Maybe if we 're more flexible ... If we watch ´Lazlo´ outside his own four walls . Shall I give the case to Udo ? I 'd like to continue it myself . Why ? It could produce results . I just need to plan more flexibly , when I come and go , days and nights ... Maybe he 's up to something outside . Something doesn 't feel right here . There 's something you 're hiding . Alright , I' ll take Udo off the case . I can use him for this church case . Give me a request in writing . Write as a reason : " Lack of suspicious acts . " And , Wiesler ! A piece of advice for you : We 're not at school anymore . Projects aren 't about grades , but success . " The state statistics office counts everything , knows everything . How many shoes I buy a year : 2 . 3 . How many books I read a year : 3 . 2 . And how many pupils graduate with straight A 's every year : 6347 . " " 5 p . m . Lazlo reads the first act of his anniversary play to Hauser and Wallner . " DENTAL PRACTICE We 're not writing a play , Christa . You don 't have to tell me . But I want to . It 's a text ... Don 't tell me . Maybe I am as unreliable as your friends say . But I ... I 'm with you now ... No matter what . Minister Riesenhuber , author of the report , said there is no quick fix for saving damaged forests . East- West German relations under strain . ' Spiegel´ magazine today published a text by an unnamed East German author about suicide in the German Democratic Republic . This follows a series of suicides by prominent East- Berlin artists , the latest being Albert Jerska . After being blacklisted for 7 years , Jerska committed suicide on January 5th . In 1977 , the GDR ceased publishing any data relating to suicides . That year , Hungary was the only country in Europe with a higher suicide rate . Yes , Sir ... But we ... General , our man at the ´Spiegel´ got us a photostat of the original . Congratulations ! So who wrote it ? He doesn 't know , but using the typeface , we 'll ... You 're hopeless ! Get me names ! I will , as soon as we get the results . If not , you 'll be put against the wall . Andrea , where 's the graphologist ? Thus I conclude that it is a domestic typewriter produced for export , most likely a ´Kolibri´ travel model , made by the VEB Groma . If the ink were black , I could be more precise . Who owns such a typewriter ? There are none registered in the GDR . What does that mean ? What does Hauser use ? Paul Hauser uses a ´Valentino´ typewriter , made by Olivetti . - That model has a more horizontal ... - Yes , yes ! And Wallner ? He writes on an Optima ´Elite ' . Georg Dreyman ? He writes his first drafts by hand , then types them up on a Wanderer ´Torpedo ' . He 's never used anything else . How big is this ´Kolibri´ typewriter ? It 's one of the smallest available : 19 . 5cm x 99cm x 19 . 55cm . So it 's as easy to smuggle as a book . Thank you . You may go . Goodbye , comrade . " The Secret Suicide Statistics " Andrea , put me through to Wiesler . " 4 p . m . The group is exhausted from so much writing . " - Yes ? - Have you heard about this article ? - In the ´Spiegel ' ? Yes . - How so ? Hauser called Dreyman and told him about it . Wiesler , this is very important . Both for my career and for yours . Did he mention who may be behind it ? Or do you have any ideas ? I don 't think he mentioned anything . No ... nothing at all . A ´Spiegel´ editor crossed the border using a false name on the 27th , and spent four hours here . Dept . VI followed him to Prenzlauer Berg , then lost his trail . Did he have contact with Dreyman ? - Wouldn 't I have noted it in the report ? - Yes , of course . But I smell a writer behind this text . I 'd be astonished if I 'm wrong . So keep your ears open ! Shit ! Get in . If one of your staff deceives you , you punish him , right ? Sure , sure ! Even a woman ? Right ? But of course ! Isn 't everyone who serves a great man part of his staff ? You could see it like that ... Indeed , you 'd have to see it like that . This is where she gets her illegal medication . Christa- Maria Sieland . You should know this , it 's your department . It 's up to you whether you ruin her or not , but I never want to see her on a German stage again . Now get out . Shut the door ! Ms . Sieland ? Please follow us . We have some questions . Come along . So ... Comrade Sieland , a beautiful career you had , hm ? A pity really . You were good . You were very good indeed . Just too short- lived . Do have a seat . What do actors do when they can 't act anymore ? Please ... Isn 't there anything I can do for you ? - For ... State Security ? - It 's a little late for that . I know nearly all our artists . I could find out a lot . I believe you . But it won 't help you now . Maybe there 's something else I could do ? Something we might both find agreeable . Unfortunately , you 've made an enemy of a very powerful man . Therefore , I have less freedom than would normally be the case . Is there no way I can save myself ? I 'm sorry , madam . There is one possibility . Since you spend so much time with writers and artists ... You don 't know anything about an article from this week 's ´Spiegel ' , do you ? An article about suicide . State Security ! Open the door ! Open up ! He 's turned on the light in his study . Go in before he destroys any evidence . Crowbar ! I don 't think that 'll be necessary . - What 's the matter , comrades ? - We have a warrant to search the premises . Warrant is here . - What are you looking for ? - It 's confidential . Boysen , Muller : bedroom . Greska : kitchen , bathroom , hall . Heise and Thomas : living room , study . Go ! What do you burn in here ? Substandard texts . A lot of Western literature , eh ? That book was a gift from Margot Honecker . - Status ? - All according to plan . We found nothing , except Western books and newspapers . - No trace to be found ! - Did you search thoroughly ? Yes , Comrade ! What 's our next move ? - Comrade ? - Pull out your men ! In the unlikely event that damage has occurred , you may claim compensation . I 'm sure everything 's in perfect order . Yes ? Wiesler , I' ll be expecting you in Hohenschonhausen at 9 a . m . tomorrow . Okay , I' ll say what we 're all thinking : It was Christa- Maria . The Stasi got her , and she ratted on you . It wasn 't her . How can you be so sure ? You yourself said she wasn 't home last night . She knows the hiding place . Yes , she knows . So if you 're right , and the search was due to her , then she 's our guardian angel . I 'm here to see Lt . Col . Grubitz . Captain Wiesler . Interrogation room 76 . Yes ! Come in . Sit down . So ? What was that about ? You 're asking me what that was about ? What do you suspect Dreyman of ? He wrote the ´Spiegel´ article . Who alleges that ? Come with me ! Here . I don 't know how you could be so sloppy as to miss all of this ! But I know you differently , especially as an interrogator . So I 'm giving you one last chance . Bring in prisoner 662 , now ! Are you still on the right side ? Yes . Then don 't screw it up again . Shall I restrain the prisoner ? No , she 's an informant now . You may go . So you 're my commanding officer ? Write . Then command me . In another 10 hours ... No , in 9 and a half , Mr . Roessing will tell the audience that you , for health reasons , cannot appear . And that will be your last mention in the acting world . Is that what you want ? Tell us where the evidence is hidden . There is no evidence , and no typewriter . I made it all up . I hope not . If so , we 'll have to keep you here . A false statement is perjury , which carries around 2 years in prison . Dreyman will go to prison anyway , on account of your statement ... and the material we 've already found in the apartment . Save yourself , at least . You have no idea how many people are in jail here for senseless heroics . Don 't forget your audience . " Don 't forget your audience ! " He has some funny ideas ! Don 't forget what the state has done for you ... Your whole life long . Now you can do something for the state . And it will thank you . Tell me where the typewriter 's hidden . Dreyman will never find out . I' ll let you go immediately , and we 'll strike only after you 're back with him . You 'll manage to feign surprise , I 'm sure . And tonight you 'll be back on stage . In your element . In front of your audience . Tell me where the documents are . Where are they ? They 're in the apartment ... Under the doorsill , between the living room and the hallway . You can remove it . Is this where you mean ? Mark the exact place with a cross . You look worn out . Remember , you 're an informant now . That means responsibilities , like conspiracy and confidentiality , but also privileges ... Guard ! Call Wiesler for me ! Col . Wiesler has left the premises , comrade . I see ! Alright . Stand down . What does a rider do when he 's thrown ? He gets back on again . Go inside . Sleep it off . What happened has nothing to do with the house . No , but with the whole country . Christa ! Stop , I was at Kerschner 's and they had no water . I need a shower . You were in a hurry to get here ! - Operation ´Lazlo´ is still in progress ! - Are they both inside ? Yes . Here 's today´s report . The last report for Operation ´Lazlo ' . Why didn 't you call me ? What ? Why didn 't you call me ? I was out in the country . Can you hand me the nail brush ? The Stasi was here . They searched the apartment . Who was here ? State Security ! Open up ! Stay here . Hello , Comrade Dreyman . I 'm Lt . Col . Grubitz from State Security . I just wanted to make sure they did a thorough job last night . Your study ? We 'll start there . Men , search carefully for notes hidden in the books . Oh , what do we have here ? This doorsill doesn 't look kosher to me . Could it be ... a secret compartment ? Let her go . She 's not a suspect . The actress ... I was too weak . I can never put right what I' ve done wrong . There 's nothing to put right ! You understand ? Nothing . I moved the ty ... Forgive me , forgive me ... Forgive me , forgive me ... Take your men back to headquarters . This mission is over . I' ve concluded the mission , Comrade Dreyman . We must have received an erroneous tip- off . Sorry . Come on . There 's one thing you should understand , Wiesler . Your career is over . Even if you were too smart to leave any traces . You 'll end up in some cellar , steam- opening letters until you retire . That means the next 20 years . 20 years ! That 's a long time .

Why am I not spared these visions ? Elena ! Go home and mourn . I will finish your shift . Too many memories , eh ? I couldn 't stay in there either . But what 's this I hear ? You 've not written since the Wall fell ? That 's not good . After all our country invested in you . Although I understand you , Dreyman . What is there to write about in this new Germany ? Nothing to believe in , nothing to rebel against ... Life was good in our little Republic . Many people only realize that now . - There is one thing I do need to ask you . - Whatever you want . Why was I never under surveillance ? Everyone else was . Why not me ? You were under full surveillance ! We knew everything about you . Full surveillance ? Every inch was bugged . The full program .

Operation ´Lazlo ' . Operation ´Lazlo ' , subject : Georg Dreyman , code- name ´Lazlo ' , is launched . The lead came from Minister Bruno Hempf . ' Lazlo´ takes delivery of a daily Western newspaper without official permission . I suggest not taking any action so as not to arouse suspicion of surveillance . ' Lazlo´ and CMS unwrap presents , then presumably have intercourse . The visitor was Paul Hauser 's uncle from West Berlin . They tell him about a play that Hauser and ´Lazlo´ will write for the GDR 's 40th anniversary . We expect further information on the play , a plot summary etc .

On September 3 , 1973 ... a blue fly capable of flapping 70 beats a minute ... landed on St . Vincent Street in Montmartre . At that moment , on a restaurant terrace nearby ... the wind magically made two glasses dance unseen ... on a tablecloth . Meanwhile , in a 5th- floor flat on Avenue Trudaine , Paris 9 ... returning from his best friend 's funeral ... Eugene Colere erased him from his address book . At the same moment , a sperm with one X chromosome ... belonging to Raphael Poulain ... made a dash for an egg in his wife Amandine . Nine months later ... Amelie Poulain was born . AMELIE FROM MONTMARTRE Her father , an ex- Army doctor ... works at a spa at Enghien Les Bains . TIGHT LIPS , HARD HEART Raphael Poulain dislikes peeing next to someone else . He also dislikes ... catching scornful glances at his sandals ... clingy wet swimming trunks . Raphael Poulain likes ... peeling large strips of wallpaper ... lining up and shining his shoes ... emptying his toolbox ... cleaning it out ... and putting everything back . Amelie 's mother ... a schoolmistress from Grugeon ... has always had shaky nerves . FACIAL TWITCH , WEAK NERVES She dislikes puckered fingers in the bath ... having her hands touched by strangers ... pillow marks on her cheek in the morning . Amandine Poulain likes figure skaters´ costumes on TV ... polishing the parquet ... emptying her handbag ... cleaning it out ... and putting everything back . Amelie is six . Like all little girls , she 'd like to be hugged by her Daddy . But he never touches her , except for a monthly checkup . The thrill of this rare contact ... makes her heart beat like a drum . As a result , he thinks she has a heart defect . Declared unfit for school ... Amelie is taught by her mother . The hens brood here henceforth . - Four hens brood ... - Very good . - Hens fourth . - No ! Deprived of playmates ... slung between a neurotic and an iceberg ... Amelie retreats into her imagination . In this world , LPs are made like pancakes . The neighbor 's comatose wife ... has chosen to get all her life 's sleep in one go . After this , I can stay awake day and night . Amelie has one friend , Blubber . Alas , the home environment has made Blubber suicidal . Blubber 's suicide attempts destroy Mother 's nerves . A decision is made . Enough ! To comfort Amelie , her mother gives her a used Instamatic . Little girl , look what you did ! A neighbor fools her ... into thinking her camera causes accidents . Having taken pictures all afternoon ... Amelie is petrified . She stares at the TV , racked by the guilt ... of causing a huge fire ... two derailments ... a jumbo jet crash . A few days later ... realizing she 'd been had ... Amelie gets her revenge . What ? ! One day , tragedy strikes . Amandine takes Amelie to Notre Dame ... to pray for a baby brother . Minutes later , heaven sends ... alas , not a baby boy ... but Marguerite , a tourist from Quebec ... bent on ending her life . Amandine dies instantly . After her mother 's death ... Amelie lives alone with her father . His unsociable tendencies increase . He 's obsessed with building a miniature shrine ... to house his wife 's ashes . Days , months , and years go by . In such a dead world , Amelie prefers to dream ... she 'll earn enough to leave home . Five years later , she 's a waitress in Montmartre ... at the Two Windmills . It 's August 29th . In 48 hours , her life will change forever ... but she doesn 't know it yet . She lives quietly among her coworkers and regulars . Suzanne , the owner ... limps a little but never spills a drink . A former bareback artiste , she likes ... athletes who cry with disappointment . She dislikes seeing men ... humiliated in front of their kids . Georgette , the tobacconist , is a hypochondriac ... migraines one day , sciatica the next . She hates the words , " fruit of thy womb . " Gina works with Amelie . Her grandma was a healer . She likes cracking bones . She brings a kir to Hipolito , a failed writer . He likes seeing bullfighters gored on TV . Scowling at them is Joseph , Gina 's rejected lover . He 's always jealously spying on her . All he likes is popping bubble wrap . Here 's Philomene , an air hostess . Amelie keeps her cat when she 's away . Philomene likes ... the sound of the cat 's bowl on the tiles . The cat likes overhearing children 's stories . No , thanks , ma 'am . I never work Sundays . On weekends , Amelie often takes a train to see her father . - Why not use your retirement ? - To do what ? Travel . You 've never been away . When we were young , your mother and I longed to travel . We couldn 't , because of your heart . I know . So , now ... Now ... Some Fridays , Amelie sees a movie . I like looking back at people 's faces in the dark . I like noticing details that no one else sees ... but I hate it in old movies ... when drivers don 't watch the road . You know , you 're a very beautiful woman , Ellie . - Why , Stan ! - A very , very beautiful woman . Amelie has no boyfriend . She tried once or twice , but the results were a letdown . Instead , she cultivates a taste for small pleasures : Dipping her hand into sacks of grain ... cracking crème brulee with a teaspoon ... and skipping stones at St . Martin 's Canal . They call him " the Glass Man . " He was born with bones as brittle as crystal . All his furniture is padded . A handshake could crush his fingers . He 's stayed inside for twenty years . Time has changed nothing . Amelie still seeks solitude . She amuses herself with silly questions ... about the world below ... such as , " how many couples are having an orgasm now ? " Fifteen ! Finally , on August 30 , 1997 ... comes the event that changes her life forever . Lady Di , Princess of Wales ... died in a car crash last night ... with her companion Dodi Al- Fayed . Only the discoverer of Tutankhamen 's tomb ... would know how she felt ... upon finding this treasure ... hidden by a little boy 40 years ago . On August 31 st at 4 : 00 a . M ... Amelie had a dazzling idea . Wherever he was , she would find the box 's owner ... and give him back his treasure . If he was touched , she 'd become a regular do- gooder . If not , too bad . The girl from the fifth floor . We don 't see much of you . Would you know of a boy who lived in my flat in the Fifties ? A boy ? Have a glass of port . - No , thanks . - Come in ! Close the door . Boys ? I' ve known so many . They 're cute ... until they discover snowballs and chestnuts . I' ve known so many boys . When did you come here ? In ´64 . You 'll have heard the story ? No . I 'm amazed . Sit down . My husband worked for Ladybird Insurance . It 's no secret he slept with his secretary . They used every hotel around . Not cheap ones , either . The bimbo liked spreading her legs ... but only on satin ... so he swiped from the till ... a little at first , then 50 million . Off they flew to Panama . Drink up . On January 20 , 1970 ... my doorbell rang . " Your husband 's been killed in a car crash in South America . " My life stopped there . Black Lion died of heartbreak . Poor creature . See how lovingly he stares at his master ? I' ll read you his letters . Don 't go ! You can spare 5 minutes . He wrote this from the Army camp . " Darling Mado ... " That 's me ... Madeleine . " I can 't sleep , can 't eat ... " knowing that my only reason to live is far away in Paris ... " and I won 't see her until next Friday ... " when my sweet little weasel appears at the station ... " in her blue dress . " In brackets ... " the one you think is too transparent . " Did anyone ever write you like that ? I 'm nobody´s little weasel . My name is Madeleine Wells . Madeleine , like Mary Magdalene . She wept , right ? Wells , as in water . Talk about being born to cry ! About your question ... ask Collignon , the grocer . He 's lived here all his life . Hello , Amelie- mellow ! A fig and three nuts , as usual ? Who lived in my flat in the Fifties ? What was their name ? You 've got me there , dear . In 1950 , I was two ... the mental age of a cretin . The " cretin " is Lucien . He 's no genius , but Amelie likes him . She likes the way ... he handles each endive like a precious object ... to be treated with care . It 's his way of showing ... his love of good work . Look at him ! Like he 's nursing a baby bird ! Don 't ask him for currants . You 'd be here till Monday ! Get moving , spastic ! She hasn 't got all day ! Go see my mother . She has an elephant 's memory . Elephant mom ! Thank you . Bredoteau . Pardon ? The name you 're after . But if I say it , it won 't count . I 'm senile . Ignore him . He 's senile . See what he 's done to my laurel ? His old job was punching metro tickets . Now he gets up every night ... to punch holes in my laurel ! Too bad it 's not hardy . We all need a way to relax . I skip stones . - You do ? - I' ll find it , don 't worry . I 'm very organized . - I like everything . - Like what ? Your son 's nearly fifty , and I 'm still doing ... his bookkeeping ! You were still squeezing his toothpaste at fifteen . - It follows . - Camus ... second floor , Broussard was on B block ... Got it ! Bredoteau , fifth floor . They were northerners . Bredoteau . What more I can say ? How could I live Never to know the joy that you give When I 'm in your arms I 'm under your charms How could I live Without you Groping under the photo booth ... is Nino Quincampoix . When Amelie lacked playmates , Nino had too many . Five miles apart , they both dreamed ... of having a brother and sister ... to be with all the time . Hi , Dad . A new friend ? I' ve had him for years . Your mother hated him , so he lived in the tool shed . There . Let 's reconcile them . There . How about that ? Dad , if you found a precious relic from your childhood ... how would you feel ? Happy ? Sad ? Nostalgic ? This gnome isn 't a relic . He was a retirement gift from my old regiment . No , I mean something you hid , like a secret treasure . I should varnish him before the autumn . I' ll make some tea . You want some ? Breathe in . Hold still . Better now ? Shut the door ! There 's a howling gale . It 's not Siberia . You 're not allergic to car fumes ! I almost coughed up my pleura last night . Cough up a pleura ? - What 's on today , Suzanne ? - Endives au gratin . They 'll have you on your knees . That 's good ? - Depends where you fall . - Lf in front of the toilet ... Not good . 12 : 15 ... laughs orgasmically to attract alpha male . He 's gonna drive me berserk . Can 't he give up ? There are plenty of other bars ! Good- bye . Madame Suzanne ? Madame Suzanne ? " Au gratin " means white sauce , right ? Yes . Why ? I can 't stomach it , like you and horse meat . It 's not my stomach , it 's my memory . I 'd rather cook human flesh . You 're kidding . Madame Suzanne , can I leave early today ? What 's his name ? Dominique Bredoteau . Hello . You 're Dominique Bredoteau ? That 's me . Why ? It 's about the petition . Petition ? Yes . The petition to ... to canonize Lady Di ! No , thanks . No . Ladies and gentlemen ... sorry to bother you ... Yes ? Hello . I 'm looking for Dominique Bredoteau ... for the European census . Come up , third floor . Hello , kitten . Earl Grey ? Jasmine ? What will you have ? I 'm busy . Here . Coming ! Where can I find Dominique Bredoteau ? Poor dear ! You just missed him . Look , there he goes now . Bretod- eau . Not Bredot- eau . You need a little mulled wine . Come in . I' ve lived here for five years . I never saw you before . I never go out on the landing . I 'm fussy about who I meet . They 're all bums . Come in . They call me the Glass Man ... but my name is Raymond Dufayel . Amelie Poulain . I 'm a waitress at ... The Two Windmills . I know . And right now , your Bredoteau basket is empty . Because it 's not " do . " It 's " to . " Like " Toto . " I love that painting . It 's the Luncheon of the Boating Party . By Renoir . I' ve painted one each year for twenty years . The hardest part is the looks . I sometimes feel like ... they deliberately change their mood behind my back . They look quite happy . They should be ! They 're eating hare with morels ... and waffles with jam for the kids . Now , where 's that piece of paper ? You 've noticed my video camera . A gift from my sister- in- law . I put it there ... so I don 't need to wind up my clocks . After all these years ... the only person I still can 't capture ... is the girl with the glass of water . She 's in the middle , yet she 's outside . Maybe she 's just different . In what way ? I don 't know . When she was little , she rarely played with other kids . Maybe never . Dominique ... Dominique Bretodeau , 27 Rue Mouffetard . It 's for you . Every Tuesday morning ... Dominique Bretodeau buys a chicken . He roasts it with potatoes . After carving the legs and wings ... he loves picking the hot carcass with his fingers ... starting with the oysters . But not today . Bretodeau won 't buy a chicken . He 'll go no further than this phone booth here . In a flash , it all came back ... Bahamontes winning the Tour de France . Aunt Josette 's slips . And most of all , the tragic day ... The day he won all the marbles . The pinch , Bretodeau ! Bretodeau , does he know what it is ? Cognac , please . Amazing , what just happened . It must be my guardian angel . The phone booth was calling me ... Same here ! The microwave 's calling me . I' ll have another cognac . Life 's funny . To a kid , time always drags . Suddenly you 're fifty . All that 's left of your childhood ... fits in a rusty little box . You got kids , Miss ? I have a daughter about your age . We haven 't spoken for years . I heard she had a child , a boy . His name is Lucas . It 's time I looked them up , before I 'm in a box myself . Don 't you think ? Amelie has a strange feeling of absolute harmony . It 's a perfect moment . Soft light ... a scent in the air , the quiet murmur of the city . She breathes deeply . Life is simple and clear . A surge of love , an urge to help mankind comes over her . Let me help you . Step down . Here we go ! The drum major 's widow ! She 's worn his coat since the day he died . The horse 's head has lost an ear ! That 's the florist laughing . He has crinkly eyes . In the bakery window , lollipops . Smell that ! They 're giving out melon slices . Sugarplum ice cream ! We 're passing the park butcher . Ham , 79 francs . Spareribs , 45 ! Now the cheese shop . Picadors are 12 . 90 . Cabecaus 23 . 50 . A baby 's watching a dog that 's watching the chickens . Now we 're at the kiosk by the metro . I' ll leave you here . Bye ! " She can 't relate to other people . " " She was always a lonely child . " On a sparkling evening in July ... while on the beaches , holiday hordes ... relax in the new- found sun ... and Paris 's sweltering denizens ... gaze at the star bursts of the traditional fireworks ... Amelie Poulain ... Godmother of Outcasts , Madonna of the Unloved ... finally succumbed to exhaustion . In Paris 's stricken streets ... a countless throng of mourners ... lined her funeral route in silence ... with the measureless grief of newly orphaned children . What a strange destiny for one who gave her all ... yet took such joy in life 's simple pleasures . Like Don Quixote , she pitted herself ... against the grinding windmills of all life 's miseries . It was a losing battle ... that claimed her life too soon . At barely 23 , Amelie Poulain ... let her young , tired body merge ... with the ebb and flow of universal woe . As she went , she felt a stab of regret ... for letting her father die ... without trying to give his stifled life ... the breath of air she had given ... to so many others . Wait ! Wait ! Wait ! Wait ! Wait ! Wait ! Wait ! Wait ! Pages full of dual ID photos ... torn up and discarded by their owners ... carefully reassembled by some oddball . Some family album ! A pack of Gaulaises . Just a second . It 's so smoky in here . Where are they ? I can 't see a thing . More to the left . More ... You need change . Forget it . A mauresque for the young man . One kir , one mauresque , and two mint sodas . Was that prenuptial or post- smooching ? Are you a congenital schmuck ? - Prenuptial . - Don 't worry . You 'll find your Mr . Right one day . All women want to sleep on a man 's shoulder . All men snore after a few drinks ... and I have a musical ear . I had my nasal cavities fixed . I see you 're a born romantic . I see you 've never known true love . I did . It shortened my leg . I thought you fell off a horse . I did . I was in love with a trapeze artist . Stupid me . They always drop you at the last minute . He dropped me just before my act . It floored me . Plus the horse ... with me under it . The mauresque ? Still , true love does exist . I know . After 30 years behind a bar ... I 'm an expert . I' ll even give you the recipe . Take two regulars ... mix them together and let them stew . It never fails . Excuse me ! Excuse me ! I' ll go . Haven 't you hurt enough people ? Gina can defend herself . I don 't mean Gina . I mean Georgette . Look ! She craves your attention ... but all you can see is Gina . Poor girl ! The things she does ... to catch your eye ! You really must be blind . I 'm off on a date . Bye ! Whoever her new one is ... he can 't be worse than that nut with his tape recorder . Joseph 's not so nutty . He 's just in pain . Come on ! They split up two months ago . To keep on coming here , he must be a masochist . Don 't say you haven 't noticed . Noticed what ? Well , he always sits here , right ? At number 8 ? Sit down . Sit down , Georgette . What can you see ? My cigarette counter . Nothing 's missing ? Well , no . Make an effort . I can 't see what ! Think about it . Good night . Letter Arrives 30 Years Late . A mailbag found by climbers on a glacier on Mont Blanc ... was part of a cargo ... lost in a plane crash in the late 1960s . So sad . A young , pretty princess for once . It 's OK if she 's old and ugly ? Sure ! Look at Mother Teresa . Is he still chasing Gina ? No , he has somebody else . Anyone I know ? Funny about this glacier ... Somebody at the Two Windmills ? Not you ! Not Suzanne ... - No ! - Yes . There he is again . How strange . - And here . - " Him again ! " " Lyon Station . " And here . " March 5 , Austerlitz . " Always the same blank face . Always neutral . Twelve times . I counted . It 's very odd . Why keep taking your picture all over town ... and throw them away ? Good one , too . It 's like a ritual . He 's probably terrified of growing old . It 's his only consolation . He 's dead ! He 's scared of being forgotten . He wants to remind people of his face . Like faxing his portrait from the afterlife . A dead man scared of being forgotten . These guys here ... have it made ! They 're long dead ... but they 'll never be forgotten . The girl with the glass ... Maybe her thoughts are with somebody else . Somebody in the picture ? More likely a boy she saw somewhere ... and felt an affinity with . You mean she 'd rather imagine herself ... relating to an absent person ... than build relationships ... with those around her ? Maybe she tries hard to fix other people 's messy lives . What about her ? Her own messy life ? Who 'll fix that ? It 's better to help people than a garden gnome . The trucker had 2 . 8 grams of alcohol in his blood ! Makes me sick . Talk about employing irresponsible morons ! - Your keys . - Hold on , Mello . Speed kills nowadays . Model yourself on Lucien . No radar will ever catch him while he 's working ! Shame on you , Mr . Collignon . It 's not his fault . True , Mrs . Couchoix . It 's not his fault he can 't sleep . It 's Lady Di 's . Guess what I found in the truck ? A lingerie catalog . He 'd pasted Lady Di 's face over the model 's ! What today ? Five asparagus ... or more local history ? Nothing . KEYS CUT WHILE YOU WAIT The migraine 's better ? Yes , but my sciatica kept me awake all night . It 's ages since I saw you looking so good . Oh , yeah ? " A woman without love wilts like a flower without sun . " Strange weather today ! What 's so funny ? You 're only the 100th one to say it . We pass the time of day to forget how time passes . We do it to keep from taking crap . I write crap that nobody publishes . - Another rejection ? - My 30th ! Isn 't your cousin a book critic ? Forget it ! Critics are like leeches ... sucking the blood of writers . Is your book ... a love story ? It 's about a guy who keeps a journal . Not about his past ... but about disasters in his future . So he gets depressed and does nothing . Basically , it 's about a loafer . I' ll dedicate the manuscript to you . So you 'll write off his tab . His scribbles for my nibbles . That 's sponsorship . What took you so long ? Look at the time ! Somebody peed in his mother ! FOOT CREAM TOOTHPASTE " Without you , today 's emotions ... " would be the scurf of yesterday 's . " " Without you , today 's emotion´s ... " would be the scurf of yesterday 's . " Without you , today 's emotions ... would be the scurf of yesterday 's . Tickets , please . How 's work ? You asked me already . You OK these days ? Pretty much . I feel a change . I had two heart attacks , an abortion , did crack ... while I was pregnant . Other than that , I 'm fine . Good . Something wrong ? No , nothing . Your gnome 's gone . Is he back in the tool shed ? Moscow . There . See ? No explanation . He wants to see the world ? I can 't understand it . LOST BAG PHOTOS Any normal girl would call the number ... meet him , return the album ... and see if her dream is viable . It 's called a reality check . The last thing Amelie wants . I say ! Could she be falling in love ? Where 's the boss ? Sleeping in the cauliflower . What ? Sleeping in the cauliflower . You want me ... want what ? A scratch card , please . How does it work ? Tell you what . Let 's both do one together . You scratch it here ... sideways . Nothing . You ? Me , neither . Unlucky at cards ... So they say . I have to get back . Yes . Porno Video Palace . I 'm calling about the ad . - You 're over 18 ? - Yes . - Shaved ? - Sorry ? Are you shaved ? Fur pie doesn 't sell . How 's life , Mrs . Wells ? When you 've nothing to live for ... Come on , life 's great ! Dream on , kid . Hello , Mr . Dufayel . Here 's your order , Mr . Dufayel . I doubt it . I hate artichokes . You shouldn 't . Watch this . Take it . That 's better . Lucien , you 're a wizard ! Courtesy of Mr . Collignon . Mister Collignon ? Sorry , it slipped out . Practice , Lucien ! Practice ! Repeat after me . Collignon , down the john .

Like a wild flower . It 's my dyspepsia . Morning , all ! Beautiful day . Pack of Gitanes , please . Bravo ! Vive la France ! You scalded me ! Ten out of ten ! Bull 's- eye ! It was Amelie , she ... When they went up Mont Blanc ... the silicon in her face froze up . Her face was a festering mass ! Mulled wine and spice cookies . I was too hard on the girl with the glass . Tell me about that boy she saw . Did they meet again ? They 're into different things . Luck is like the Tour de France . You wait , and it flashes past you . You have to catch it while you can . Can I help you ? Excuse me . I found this in the street . Nino will be glad ! He was so sad the other day . I almost prayed to St . Anthony ! Is ... Nino here now ? On Wednesdays he works at the funfair . How long has he had this collection ? Since I got him the job here , last year . Before , he collected footprints . He worked nights . In the daytime , he took pictures of footprints in wet cement . He 's a funny guy . When we met , he was a Santa Claus . Other things , like ... whenever he heard a funny laugh , he 'd tape it . Gosh ! Must be hard for his girlfriend . He never keeps them long . Times are hard for dreamers . Eva ! Are those coffees coming ? Gotta go . Thanks for the album . It 's OK . I have time to take it to the funfair . Suit yourself . The Ghost Train . Ask for Nino Quincompoix . Is Nino here ? He doesn 't get in till 7 : 00 . Is there no way to see him before ? Sure . 20 francs . See you next Wednesday . 5 p . m . Tomorrow , Montmartre carousel . Bring 5 francs . Want to know about her ? - You know her ? - You bet ! She put us in her shirt pocket . Next to her breast . - Is she pretty ? - Not bad . - Beautiful . - No . Pretty . - Beautiful ! - Pretty . - What does she want from me ? - She 's broke . She wants a reward for the album . Or else she collects photos , too . She wants to trade us for a one- eyed man with glasses ! No , you dope ! She 's in love . - I don 't even know her . - You do . Since when ? Since always . In your dreams . You ! Man with the plastic bag ! It 's for you . Follow the blue arrows , Mr . Quincompoix . The fool looks at a finger that points at the sky ... I know the stranger in the pictures . He 's a ghost . He 's invisible ! He only appears when the film is developed . When a girl has her photo taken ... he goes " Wooo ! " in her ear ... while he fondles her neck . That 's how he got caught , Mr . Quincompoix ! Who are you ? Page St . DO YOU WANT TO MEET ME ? Listen to this . " Boy of 6 , while parents sleep ... " drives off in a pedal car . " Found on a highway in Germany ... " he told police he wanted to see the stars . " Ain 't life beautiful , though ? Love . The only bug she hadn 't caught . - Nobody 's immune . - It gives me a break . Love 's a great beautician . What 's she like ? Tall , small ? Fair , dark ? Let 's say ... average height . Not a dwarf or a giraffe . Normal . Pretty , for her type . As for fair or dark , it 's hard to say . She wasn 't a redhead . Unless ... Forget it . I remember she casually asked about your girlfriend . And ? I said you weren 't interested , right ? You didn 't ! What do you care ? You don 't even know her . - Exactly . It 's the mystery . - You won 't find mystery here . A pound of nectarines . The ones here are the prettiest . Trust him . He 's an artist . He goes home with a ton of unsold stock . What for ? Is he stewing a pig ? No , sir ! He 's studying art ! Sells leeks all day long and paints turnips all night ! The boy 's a useless vegetable ! With a prompter ... in each cellar window whispering comebacks ... shy people would have the last laugh . At least you 'll never be a vegetable ! Even artichokes have hearts . You 'll never be a vegetable . Even artichokes have hearts ! " Darling Mado , I miss you more and more each day . " I 'm an exile in a world of dreary khaki . " I can 't sleep , can 't eat ...

WHERE & WHEN ? One hour later , on Boulevard St . Martin ... Amelie walks into a party goods and costume shop . At the same time , a man leaves his home on Rue Lecourbe . 26 minutes later , Amelie is at East Station . Simultaneously , the man in red shoes parks outside . The time is exactly 11 : 40 . At this precise moment ... only Amelie has the key to the riddle of the mystery man . How 's it going , Mrs . Wells ? Not so bad when it 's not raining . - This is for you . - Me ? " Dear Mrs . Wells , we recently recovered a mailbag ... " that was lost in a plane crash ... " on October 12th , 1969 , on Mont Blanc . " We are forwarding the enclosed letter to your address ... " with our apologies for the uncustomary delay . " Jacques Grasjeau , Customer Services . " " Darling Mado , I 'm in exile . I can 't sleep , can 't eat ... " I think of you endlessly . " I know I' ve made the mistake of my life . " I turned down that woman 's money . " If all goes well , I' ll soon be able to afford a house . " I dream of better times ahead ... " when you 'll forgive me and join me here ... " one orange- colored day . Your everloving Adrien . " Another package for you . You heard about the concierge ? She got a letter . From her husband , 40 years late . That 's a lot , isn 't it ? I 'm not big on still life , Mr . Dufayel . Then work on your lean layer . Fat over lean . Always ! I heard there 'll soon be a new star . You 're into stars now ? I saw it on TV at my ma 's , that 's why . I dunno if it 's true . In America ... they 'll take rich people 's ashes ... put them in a satellite ... and shoot it into space . It 's going to shine forever . And Lady Di ... will they do the same for her ? Lady Di ! Lady Di ! Give it a rest ! I can 't concentrate ! Lady Di ! Lady Di ! Renoir ! I don 't understand . Brilliant ! You were perfect . Did it work ? It 's getting there . Ask me again anytime . The harm 's done . - Harm ? - Everybody calls me Snow White ! The Two Windmills at 4 p . m . Could you stand in for me at 4 : 00 ? Again ? What 's eating him ? - I smile too much . - He 'd rather you frowned ? With other men , yes . Nino is late . Amelie can only see two explanations . 1 ... He didn 't get the photo . 2 ... Before he could assemble it ... a gang of bank robbers took him hostage . The cops gave chase . They got away ... but he caused a crash . When he came to , he 'd lost his memory . An ex- con picked him up ... mistook him for a fugitive and shipped him to Istanbul . There he met some Afghan raiders ... who took him to steal some Russian warheads . But their truck hit a mine in Tajikistan . He survived , took to the hills ... and became a Mujaheddin . Amelie refuses to get upset for a guy ... who 'll eat borscht all his life in a hat like a tea cozy . - What can I get you ? - Coffee , please . TODAY 'S MENU He 's understood . He 's going to put down his spoon ... dip his finger in the sugar ... turn around slowly and speak to me . Is this you ? Yes , it 's you . - More coffee ? - No thanks . So it 's this man here , with his hand up ? Is she in love with him ? I think it 's time she took a real risk . She might . She 's devising a stratagem . She 's fond of stratagems . In fact , she 's cowardly . That 's why I can 't capture her look . Dufayel 's attempts to meddle are intolerable ! If Amelie chooses to live in a dream ... and remain an introverted young woman ... she has an absolute right to mess up her life ! What are you doing ? Tell me , Lucien . For deliveries , do you keep keys to all the apartments ? One of your booths is out of order . It seems to be jammed . East Station ticket hall . Buy a video , get one free ? Samantha ? Can you stand in for me at ... Photo booth . East Station . Tuesday 5 p . m . Almost done . The mystery man wasn 't a ghost or a man scared of aging ... but simply the repairman ... a normal technician doing his work . He keeps spying on me . It 's making me sick . 4 : 05 : Blatant female conspiracy . Gosh , you 're tense ! Good luck . You 'll need it . Excuse me . Did you put this in my pocket ? - Yes , but it 's not from me . - I know . Where is she ? She 's at her father 's . It bothers me . Can I talk to you ? I get off at 6 : 00 . - Can you come back ? - OK . See you then . 4 : 08 : Docking scheduled . A blond guy in a camel coat . Absent- minded , too . How come ? He came back three times the same day . 1 : 12 ... Camel coat . 2 : 50 ... Camel coat . - 4 : 17 . - Stop it ! My rash has come back ! Look . Suzanne ! My rash is back . He 's driving me nuts ! Lay off ! Her conscience is at fault . I' ve had it ! I 'm going home . Psychos are the last straw ! Stop smothering them . Women need air . You give them air , they blow you off . Fresh air 's healthy . Cram it , failure ! Failed writer , failed life ... I love the word " fail . " Failure is human destiny . It 's gasbag time ! Failure teaches us that life is but a draft ... a long rehearsal for a show that will never play . I bet he stole that . I do have some original ideas ... but people always steal them . Same as your women . Meaning ? You 'd better get used to it . Speak for yourself , you ... - What 's going on ? - Nothing much . Georgette went out , Joseph got mad . " Went out " ? Like Gina . You know who Gina 's with ? The guy with the plastic bag ! I saw their little game . The note in the coat pocket . 4 : 08 . Back he comes , and hey presto ! Out they go . I 'm worried for Amelie because I like you . What do you mean ? By and large , the men I like are mentally unsound . I 'd like to know more about you . Ask me . One swallow doesn 't make ? A swallow ? A summer . Practice makes ... Perfect . - Curiosity ... - Killed the cat . - Haste ... - Makes waste . - Rolling stone ... - Gathers no moss . - It 's a sin ... - To steal a pin . - Absence makes ... - The heart grow fonder . - Not bad . - You collect them ? At home , we say a man who knows proverbs can 't be all bad . Pretty girl from the fifth floor , listen to this ! - You believe in miracles ? - Not today . You 're in for a surprise . What if I told you that a team of climbers ... on Mont Blanc had found ... hard proof that my husband loved me ? Lucien , I need some yeast . For Miss Amelie ? She 's baking her famous plum cake ? Collignon ! Go ! I' ll be right back . I' ll be back . Go into the bedroom , Miss Poulain . So , little Amelie ... your bones aren 't made of glass . You can take life 's knocks . If you let this chance go by ... eventually , your heart will become ... as dry and brittle as my skeleton . So ... go get him , for Pete 's sake ! " Without you , today 's emotions ... " would be the scurf of yesterday 's . " International airport . September 28 , 1997 . It is exactly 11 a . m . At the funfair , near the ghost train ... the marshmallow twister 's twisting ... while in Villette Park , Felix Lerbier ... learns there are more links in his brain ... than atoms in the universe . At the Sacre Coeur ... the Cardinals are practicing their backhands . The temperature is 24 degrees Celsius . Humidity , 70 % . Atmospheric pressure , 999 millibars . When I was lying there in the VA hospital , with a big hole blown through the middle of my life , I started having these dreams of flying . I was free . Sooner or later , though , you always have to wake up . They can fix a spinal , if you got the money , but not on vet benefits , not in this economy . A VA check and 12 bucks will get you a cup of coffee . I 'm what they call ... waitlisted . The Bengal Tiger , extinct for over a century is making a comeback . These cloned tiger cubs at the Beijing Zoo are the latest of a number of species that have been cloned back into existence in the past five years . I became a marine for the hardship . To be hammered on the anvil of life . I told myself I can pass any test a man can pass . Jake ! Jake ! Jake ! Jake ! Jake ! Let 's get it straight , upfront . I do n't want your pity . You want a fair deal , you 're on the wrong planet . The strong prey on the weak . That 's just the way things are . And nobody does a damn thing . Get off ! Get off of him ! All I ever wanted in my sorry-ass life was a single thing worth fighting for . I hope you realized you just lost yourself a customer . Candy-ass bitch . If it ai n't raining , we ai n't training . It does n't look like him . It 's him . You Jake Sully ? Step off . You 're ruining my good mood . It 's about your brother . We 're looking for Sully , T . In there . Jesus , Tommy . The strong prey on the weak . A guy with a knife took all Tommy would ever be for the paper in his wallet . The concern of the suits was touching . Your brother represented a significant investment . We 'd like to talk to you about taking over his contract . And since your genome is identical to his , you could step into his shoes , so to speak . It 'd be a fresh start on a new world . You could do something important . You can make a difference . And the pay is good . Very good . Tommy was the scientist , not me . He was the one who wanted to get shot light-years out in space to find the answers . Me , I was just another dumb grunt getting sent someplace he was gonna regret . In cryo , you do n't dream at all . It does n't feel like six years . More like a fifth of tequila and an ass-kicking . Are we there yet ? Yeah , we 're there , sunshine . We 're there . You 've been in cryo for five years , nine months and 22 days . You will be hungry . You will be weak . If you feel nausea , please use the sacks provided for your convenience . The staff thanks you in advance . Up ahead was Pandora . You grew up hearing about it , but I never figured I 'd be going there . Valkyrie 1-6 , copy ... Valkyrie 1-6 , you are clear for de-orbit burn at 2-2-4-niner . Copy , Venture Star . Go for de-orbit burn at 2-2-4-niner . Exo-packs on ! Let 's go ! Exo-packs on ! Exo-packs on ! Let 's go ! Remember , people , you lose that mask , you 're unconscious in 20 seconds , you 're dead in four minutes ! Let 's nobody be dead today ! Looks very bad on my report . Hell 's Gate tower , this is TAV 1-6 on approach . Crossing outer marker . Mine is in sight . Harnesses off ! Get your packs ! Put it together , let 's go ! Let 's go ! Harnesses off ! One minute ! When that ramp comes down , go directly into the base . Do not stop ! Go straight inside . Wait for my mark ! Go , go , go , go ! Get out of there ! Keep moving ! Let 's go , let 's go ! There 's no such thing as an ex-Marine . You may be out , but you never lose the attitude . Let 's go , special case ! Do not make me wait for you ! Well , well , ladies . Look at all this fresh meat ! Back on Earth , these guys were Army dogs , Marines , fighting for freedom . Look out , hot rod ! But out here they 're just hired guns , taking the money , working for the company . Check this out , man . Meals on wheels . Oh , man , that is just wrong . I got two guys free in about 20 minutes ! Got it ! Need them ! You 're not in Kansas anymore . You are on Pandora , ladies and gentlemen . Respect that fact every second of every day . If there is a hell , you might want to go there for some R_et_R after a tour on Pandora . Out there , beyond that fence , every living thing that crawls , flies or squats in the mud wants to kill you and eat your eyes for Jujubes . We have an indigenous population of humanoids called the Na 'vi . They 're fond of arrows dipped in a neurotoxin that 'll stop your heart in one minute . And they have bones reinforced with naturally occurring carbon fiber . They are very hard to kill . As head of security , it is my job to keep you alive . I will not succeed . Not with all of you . If you wish to survive , you need to cultivate a strong mental attitude . You 've got to obey the rules . Pandora rules . Rule number one ... There 's nothing like an old-school safety brief to put your mind at ease . Excuse me . Excuse me . Jake ! You 're Jake , right ? Tom 's brother . Wow ! You look just like him . Sorry , I 'm Norm . Spellman . I went through avatar training with him . into the bio-lab . We 're gonna spend a lot of time up here . Hey ! How you doing ? Norm , avatar driver . Hi . Hey . Link ... Here 's the link room right here . This is where we 're connecting to the avatar . Me and Norm are here to drive these remotely controlled bodies called avatars . And they 're grown from human DNA mixed with the DNA of the natives . Hey . Welcome . Hey . Welcome to Pandora . Good to have you . Thanks . Damn ! They got big . Yeah , they fully mature on the flight out . So the proprioceptive sims seem to work really well . Yeah , they 've got great muscle tone . It 'll take us a few hours to get them decanted , but you guys can take them out tomorrow . There 's yours . Hey . Dr . Norm Spellman . Dr . Max Patel . Great to meet you . Good to meet you , yeah . Looks like him . No , it looks like you . This is your avatar now , Jake . And the concept is that every driver is matched to his own avatar , so that their nervous systems are in tune , or something . Which is why they offered me the gig , because I can link with Tommy 's avatar , which is insanely expensive . Is this right ? I just say whatever to the video log ? Yeah , we gotta get in the habit of documenting everything . You know , what we see , what we feel . It 's all part of the science . And good science is good observation . Plus it 'll help to keep you sane for the next six years . All right . Whatever . So ... Well , here I am , doing science . They 're coming out ! Attention . Drivers coming out of link . Oh , God . Where 's the lab coat ? Where 's the lab coat ? Who 's got my goddamn cigarette ? Guys ! What 's wrong with this picture ? Thank you ! Grace Augustine is a legend . She 's the head of the Avatar Program . She wrote the book , I mean , literally wrote the book on Pandoran botany . Well , that 's 'cause she likes plants better than people . Here she is , Cinderella back from the ball . Grace , I 'd like you to meet Norm Spellman and Jake Sully . Norm . I hear good things about you . How 's your Na 'vi ? May the All Mother ... smile upon our first meeting . Not bad . You sound a little formal . I studied for five years ... but there is much to learn . Grace ? This is Jake Sully . Ma 'am . Yeah , yeah . I know who you are , and I do n't need you . I need your brother . You know , the PhD who trained for three years for this mission ? He 's dead . I know it 's a big inconvenience for everyone . How much lab training have you had ? I dissected a frog once . You see ? You see ? I mean , they 're just pissing on us without even the courtesy of calling it rain . I 'm going to Selfridge . No , Grace , I do n't think that 's a good idea . No , man , this is such bullshit ! I 'm gonna kick his corporate butt . He has no business sticking his nose in my department . Here tomorrow , 0800 . Try and use big words . Scorpion Two-Hotel , Hell 's Gate tower . You are cleared for south departure . Hover taxi , Delta runway . Squawk ident . You see that ? Yes , sir . No , you did n't . You were looking at the monitor . I love this putter , Ronnie ! I love this putter . Parker , you know , I used to think it was benign neglect , but now I see that you 're intentionally screwing me . Grace , you know , I enjoy our little talks . I need a researcher . Not some jarhead dropout . Well , actually , I thought we got lucky with him . Lucky ? Yeah . How is this in any way lucky ? Lucky your guy had a twin brother , and lucky that brother was n't some oral hygienist or something . A Marine we can use . I 'm assigning him to your team as security escort . The last thing I need is another trigger-happy moron out there ! Look , look , you 're supposed to be winning the hearts and the minds of the natives . Is n't that the whole point of your little puppet show ? If you look like them and you talk like them , then they 'll start trusting us . We build them a school , we teach them English , but after , what , how many years ? Relations with the indigenous are only getting worse . Yeah , that tends to happen when you use machine guns on them . Right . Come here . I ca n't ... I ca n't ... This is why we 're here . Unobtanium . Because this little gray rock sells for 20 million a kilo . That 's the only reason . It 's what pays for the whole party . It 's what pays for your science . Now , those savages are threatening our whole operation , we 're on the brink of war , and you 're supposed to be finding a diplomatic solution . So use what you 've got , and get me some results . So , how much link time have you logged ? About 520 hours . That 's good . You 're in there . You 're here . How much have you logged ? Zip . But I read a manual . Tell me you 're joking . This is cool . Let 's go . Do n't . I got this . So you just figured you 'd come out here , to the most hostile environment known to man , with no training of any kind , and see how it went ? What was going through your head ? Maybe I was sick of doctors telling me what I could n't do . Biometrics are good . Link three is ready . Keep your arms in , hands in , head down . Down . Just relax and let your mind go blank . That should n't be hard for you . Kiss the darkest part of my lily white ... Initiate link . Run sequence unit three . Go . Launching . I have the first congruency . That 's a gorgeous brain . Nice activity . Go figure . Phase-Iock 40 . All right . Going in . I 'm going in in four . Phase-Iock 99 . Link is stable . He 's in . Jake , can you hear me ? Can you hear me , Jake ? Pupillary reflex is good . Pinna response normal . How you feeling , Jake ? Hey , guys . Welcome to your new body , Jake . Good ! Yeah , we 're gonna take this nice and easy , Jake . And touch your thumb to your fingers . Yeah . Thumb to your fingers . No problem . That 's good . I can see you can remember that one . Got it . Well , if you want to sit up , that 's fine . Okay , good . Just take it nice and slow , Jake . Good . Okay , well , no truncal ataxia , that 's good . Are you feeling lightheaded or dizzy at all ? You 're wiggling your toes ! Good . Good , Jake . That 's great . Distal motor control is good . Good , Jake . Are you feeling any numbness or pain ? That 's great , Jake . Hold on , now . Take it easy . Do n't get ahead of yourself , okay ? There 's a few more sensory motor reflex tests we need to run , so take it easy . Wait . Jake . Sit down , Jake . Jake ! Listen to me . Jake ! I need you to sit down . Jake ! It 's okay . Buddy , listen to me . It 's all good . I got this . Jake , you need to sit down right now . Guys , get him back on the gurney now . Listen to me . For your own safety , you need to sit down . You need time to adjust to the avatar ... Whoa ! Jake ! God , Jake , watch your tail . Yeah ! Sedate ! Sedate him ! A thousand milligrams of Supitocam ! Stat ! Guys ! Guys ! Whoa ! Whoa ! By the numbers . Jake . Come on . Jake ! Listen to me . You 're not used to your avatar body . This is dangerous . This is great . Jake ? Jake , listen to me . Come on . They 're gonna put you out . Norm , sit down . No , no . I gotta get out of these leads . God damn it ! Bring them home ! Norm ! Do not leave control ! You 're not ready for it ! Oh , come on , you ai n't got no skills . So close ! I do n't even have to play defense on it . Hey , guys . Hey . It 's okay , I 'll get him . Jake , you have to come back ! Jake ! Jake ! Excuse me . Watch it ! Sorry ! Come on ! Jake ! We 're not supposed to be running ! Jeez ! Sorry . Watch it ! Hey , Marine ! Damn . Grace ? Well , who 'd you expect , numbnuts ? Think fast . Motor control 's looking good . Come on , everybody , quiet down ! All right , gang , lights out . Come on , Louise , chop-chop . Hey , hey , hey ! Do n't play with that , you 'll go blind . That 's kind of freaky . Come on . Scat . Good night . Lights out ! See you at dinner , kiddies . Welcome back . You okay ? You all right ? Yeah , I 'm okay . I 'm Trudy . I fly all the science sorties . And this here is my baby . Hold on a second . Hey , Wainfleet ! Get it done ! We bounce at zero-nine . Yeah , I 'm on it , capitaine ! Vine strike 's still loose . You guys are packing some heavy gear . Watch it ! Yeah , that 's 'cause we 're not the only thing flying around out there . Or the biggest . I 'm gonna need you on a door gun . I 'm a man short . I thought you 'd never ask . There 's your man . See you on the flight line . You wanted to see me , Colonel ? This low gravity 'll make you soft . You get soft , Pandora will shit you out dead with zero warning . I pulled your record , Corporal . Venezuela , that was some mean bush . Nothing like this here , though . You got some heart , kid , showing up in this neighborhood . I figured it 's just another hellhole . I was First Recon myself . A few years ahead of you . Well , maybe more than a few . Three tours Nigeria , not a scratch . I come out here ? Day one . Think I felt like a shavetail louie ? Yeah . They could fix me up , if I rotated back . Yeah , and make me pretty again . But you know what ? I kind of like it . It reminds me every day what 's waiting out there . The Avatar Program is a bad joke . Bunch of limp-dick science majors . However , it does present an opportunity both timely and unique . Clear ! Clear ! A recon gyrene in an avatar body . That 's a potent mix . Give me the goose bumps . Such a Marine could provide the intel I need , right on the ground . Right in the hostiles ' camp . Look , Sully . I want you to learn these savages from the inside . I want you to gain their trust . I need to know how to force their cooperation or hammer them hard if they wo n't . Am I still with Augustine ? On paper . Yeah , you walk like one of her science pukes , you quack like one , but you report to me . Can you do that for me , son ? Hell , yeah , sir . Well , all right , then . Son , I take care of my own . You get me what I need , I 'll see to it you get your legs back when you rotate home . Your real legs . That sounds real good , sir . Link 's ready ! Phase-Iock 40 . Just keep your mouth shut and let Norm do the talking . I have five congruencies . Phase-Iock 90 . Link three ready . All right , I 'm going in . Sturmbeest herd coming up on your right . Got it ! Thanks . Looks like a bull , a dozen cows and some juveniles . Shut it down . We 're gonna stay a while . Norm ! Your pack . Pack . Stay with the ship . One idiot with a gun is enough . You the man , Doc . Prolemuris . They 're not aggressive . Relax , Marine . You 're making me nervous . So , how will they know we 're here ? I 'm sure they 're watching us right now . This was our school . Now it 's just ... storage . The kids were so bright . Eager to learn . They picked up English faster than I could teach it . So , we 'll take a couple of these Ph monitors ... and a soil probe . That little yellow case back there . The old microscope . Here . Oh , yeah . I love this one . The stingbats knocked them down . I keep hoping someone will come back in and read them . Why do n't they come back ? The Omaticaya ... learned as much about us as they needed to . What happened here ? Are you going to help us with this gear ? We 've got a lot to do . Keep moving , Norm . Keep up , guys ! And here I go . Scanning . Wow ! It 's that fast ? Amazing , is n't it ? Yeah . So , that is signal transduction from this root to the root of the tree next to it . So , we should take a sample . Okay . Sample . You know , it 's probably electrical , based on the speed of the reaction . Norm , you 've contaminated the sample with your saliva . Right . So , here I go . Do n't shoot . Do n't shoot , you 'll piss him off . It 's already pissed off . Jake , that armor 's too thick . Trust me . It 's a territorial threat display . Do not run , or he 'll charge . So , what do I do , dance with it ? Just hold your ground . Yeah ? Come on ! What you got ? Oh , yeah . Who 's bad ? That 's right . Yeah , that 's what I 'm talking about , bitch . That 's right , get your punk ass back to mommy . Yeah ? Yeah , you got nothing . You keep running . Yeah , and why do n't you bring back some of your friends , huh ? Oh , shit . So what about this one ? Run ? Do n't run ? What ? Run ! Definitely run ! I 'm gonna have to call it , guys . We 're not allowed to run night ops . Colonel 's orders . I 'm sorry , Doc , he 's just gonna have to hang on till morning . He wo n't make it till morning . I do n't have all goddamn night . Come on ! Come on ! Hey , wait . Do n't ! Great . Look , I know you probably do n't understand this , but thank you . Thank you . That was pretty impressive . I would have been screwed if you had n't come along . It was ... Hey , wait a second . Hey , where you going ? Wait up ! Just ... Hey , slow down . Look , wait up , I just wanted to say thanks for killing those things . Damn ! Do n't thank . You do n't thank for this . This is sad . Very sad only . Okay . Okay . I 'm sorry . Whatever I did , I am sorry . All this is your fault . They did not need to die . My fault ? They attacked me . How am I the bad guy ? Your fault ! Your fault ! Easy . Easy . You 're like a baby . Making noise , do n't know what to do . Easy . Fine . Fine . If you love your little forest friends , why not let them just kill my ass ? What 's the thinking ? Why save you ? Yeah . Yeah , why save me ? You have a strong heart . No fear . But stupid ! Ignorant like a child . Well , if I 'm like a child , then ... Look , maybe you should teach me . Sky People cannot learn . You do not See . Well , then teach me how to See . No one can teach you to See . Whoa . Look , come on , ca n't we talk ? Say , where 'd you learn to speak English ? Dr . Augustine 's school ? You 're like a baby . I need your help . You should not be here . Okay , take me with you . No ! Go back . No . Go back . No ! What ... What are they ? Seeds of the Sacred Tree . Very pure spirits . What was that all about ? Come . Come ! Where are we going ? Come . What 's your name ? Shit ! Okay . Calm people , calm . What are you doing , Tsu 'tey ? These demons are forbidden here . There has been a sign . This is a matter for the Tsahik . Bring him . What 's going on ? Wait . What 's happening ? Hey ! Father ... I see you . This creature ... why do you bring him here ? I was going to kill him ... but there was a sign from Eywa . I have said ... no dreamwalker will come here . What 's he saying ? His alien smell fills my nose . Hey , what 's he saying ? My father is deciding whether to kill you . Your father . It 's nice to meet you , sir . Step back ! I will look at this alien . That is Mother . She is Tsahik . The one who interprets the will of Eywa . Who 's Eywa ? What are you called ? Jake Sully . Why did you come to us ? I came to learn . We have tried to teach other Sky People . It is hard to fill a cup which is already full . Well , my cup is empty , trust me . Just ask Dr . Augustine . I 'm no scientist . What are you ? I was a Marine . A ... A warrior of the Jarhead clan . A warrior ! I could kill him easily ! No ! This is the first warrior dreamwalker ... we have seen . We need to learn more about him . My Daughter ... you will teach him our way ... to speak and walk as we do . Why me ? That 's not fair ... It is decided . My daughter will teach you our ways . Learn well , Jakesully . Then we will see if your insanity can be cured . Good evening . Please do n't get up . Excuse me . Sorry . Hey , how you doing ? Thank you . You know , I do n't even know your name . Neytiri te Ckaha Mo 'at . Neytiri te Ckaha Mo 'at . Again , a whole lot slower ? Neytiri . Neytili . Neytiri . Neytiri . It 's nice to meet you , Neytiri . It 's nice . Jake . Jake ! He 's in alpha . He 's coming out right now . Jake . Jake ! Come on back , kid . Come on . That 's it . There you go . There you go , there you go . You 're okay . You 're okay . Damn ! You were dug in like a tick . Is the avatar safe ? Yeah , Doc . And you are not gonna believe where I am . The last thing we see is this Marine 's ass disappearing into the brush with this angry thanator coming after him . Hey , it 's not something you can teach . That is awesome . You know , for reasons I cannot fathom , the Omaticaya have chosen you . God help us all . Jarhead clan ? And it worked ? Hey , I 'm practically family . They 're gonna study me . I have to learn to be one of them . That 's called taking the initiative , son . I wish I had 10 more like you . Look , Sully . Sully . Just find out what the blue monkeys want . You know , I mean , we try to give them medicine , education , roads . But no , no , no , they like mud . And that would n't bother me , it 's just that they 're ... Hey , can you ... Can somebody just ... Sector 12 . Okay , go , go , go , stop . Stop ... Rich , stop ! That 's ... Jesus ! Their damn village happens to be resting on the richest unobtanium deposit within 200 klicks in any direction . I mean , look at all that cheddar ! Well , who gets them to move ? Guess . What if they wo n't go ? I 'm betting that they will . Okay , okay , okay , okay , hey . Look . Look . Killing the indigenous looks bad , but there 's one thing that shareholders hate more than bad press , and that 's a bad quarterly statement . I did n't make up the rules . So just find me a carrot that 'll get them to move , otherwise it 's gonna have to be all stick . Okay ? You got three months . That 's when the 'dozers get there . Well , we 're wasting time . I like this guy . Guys , right now ... Okay , let 's run through them again . Mo 'at . Dragon lady . Eytucan . Eytukan . He 's the clan leader . But she 's the spiritual leader . Like a shaman . Got it . T 'su . Tsu 'tey . Tsu 'tey . He 'll be the next clan leader . Neytiri . She 'll be the next Tsahik . They become a mated pair . So who 's this Eywa ? Who 's Eywa ? Only their deity . Their goddess , made up of all living things . Everything they know ! You 'd know this if you had any training whatsoever . Who 's got a date with the chief 's daughter ? Come on . That 's ... Knock it off . It 's like kindergarten around here . Neytiri was my best student . She and her sister , Sylwanin . Just amazing girls . I got a date with Sylwanin too . She 's dead . Let 's go . Village life starts early . Do n't do anything unusually stupid . Easy , boy . Pale is female . Okay . Easy , girl . That is shahaylu . The bond . Feel her . Feel her heartbeat . Her breath . Feel her strong legs . You may tell her what to do . Inside . For now , say where to go . Forward ! You should go away . No , you 'd miss me . I knew you could speak English . This alien will learn nothing ... a rock sees more ... look at him . Again . If you want to hit this thing , it 's gonna be complicated . Your scan does n't show the internal structure . There 's an outer row of columns . Real heavy duty . There 's a secondary ring here , and an inner ring . There 's a core structure like a spiral . That 's how they move up and down . We 're gonna need accurate scans on every column . Roger that . What else can you tell us about the structure ? I 'm guessing this secondary ring , that 's also load-bearing . So where are we going ? Getting out of Dodge . I 'm not about to let Selfridge and Quaritch micro-manage this thing . There 's a mobile link up at Site 26 we can work out of , way up in the mountains . The Hallelujah Mountains ? That 's right . Are you serious ? Yeah . Yes ! The legendary floating mountains of Pandora . Heard of them ? We 're getting close . Yeah , look at my instruments . Yep . We 're in the Flux Vortex . We 're VFR from here on . What 's VFR ? Means you gotta see where you 're going . You ca n't see anything . Exactly . Ai n't that a bitch ? Oh , my God . You should see your faces . Thank you for flying Air Pandora . So what does hold them up ? Grace explained it to me . Some kind of maglev effect . Because unobtanium is a superconductor ... or something . Welcome to camp . So , this is my bunk . This stuff is nasty . Norm , go under . All right . Grace did n't miss a thing . Trudy , you 'll take the top one . She knew I was talking to the Colonel . But I had what she needed , a way back in with the clan , so she 's playing nice . All right . Jake , hang a left . You 'll be in the link at the end . Unit one . Beulah . She 's the least glitchy . Holy shit ! Do not look in her eye . Ikran is not horse . Once shahaylu is made , ikran will fly with only one hunter in the whole life . To become taronyu , hunter , you must choose your own ikran and he must choose you . When ? When you are ready . Okay . This is video log 12 . Time 's 2132 . Do I have to do this now ? I really need to get some rack . No , now . When it 's fresh . Okay , location , shack , and the days are starting to blur together . The language is a pain , but , you know , I figure it 's like field-stripping a weapon . Just repetition , repetition . Navi . Nari . Nari . Narrri ! Narrri ! Txurni 'ul . Stronger . Neytiri calls me skxawng . It means moron . This is a very important part of it . Norm 's attitude has improved lately . I see you . I see you . But it 's not just , I 'm seeing you in front of me , it 's I see into you . I See you . It 's good he 's back on board , but he thinks I 'm a skxawng , too . I 'm accepting you . I understand you . So you gotta get this , okay ? I gotta run ! Okay ? Let 's go . My feet are getting tougher . I can run farther every day . I have to trust my body to know what to do . Yeah ! Check it out ! Oh , crap ! Every day it 's reading the trails , the tracks at the waterhole , the tiniest scents and sounds . She 's always going on about the flow of energy , the spirits of animals . I really hope this tree-hugger crap is n't on the final . This is n't just about eye-hand coordination out there , you know . You need to listen to what she says . Try to see the forest through her eyes . Excuse me . This is my video log here . With Neytiri , it 's learn fast or die . You gotta be kidding me . I talked Mo 'at into letting Grace into the village . Look how big you are . It 's the first time since her school was closed down . You are so pretty . Come on , Marine . I 'm trying to understand this deep connection the people have to the forest . She talks about a network of energy that flows through all living things . She says all energy is only borrowed , and one day you have to give it back . You were in 16 hours today . You 're still losing weight . No , you do n't . I gotta get some sleep . Come back here . Bon appetit . Today I made a kill . And we ate it . At least , I know where that meal came from . Other body . You need to take care of this body . Okay ? Get it ? Let 's eat it . Yeah , yeah . Here . I 'll make it easy for you . Give it to me . You look like crap . Thank you . You 're burning way too hard . Get rid of this shit . And then you can lecture me . Now , I 'm telling you , as your boss , and as someone who might even consider being a friend someday to take some down time . Eat this , please . Trust me , I ... learned the hard way . What did happen at the school , Grace ? Neytiri 's sister , Sylwanin , stopped coming to school . She was angry about the clear-cutting . And one day , she and a couple of other young hunters came running in all painted up . They had set a bulldozer on fire . I guess they thought I could protect them . The troopers pursued them to the school . They killed Sylwanin in the doorway . Right in front of Neytiri . And then shot the others . I got most of the kids out . But they never came back . I 'm sorry . A scientist stays objective . We ca n't be ruled by emotion . But I put 10 years of my life into that school . They called me sa 'nok . Mother . Mother . That kind of pain reaches back through the link . I see you ... Brother and thank you . Your spirit goes with Eywa . Your body stays behind ... to become part of The People . A clean kill . You are ready . Learning to ride an ikran , we call them banshees , is the test every young hunter has to pass . But to do that , you gotta go where the banshees are . Oo-rah . Now what ? Jakesully will go first . Now you choose your ikran . This you must feel inside . If he also chooses you , move quick like I showed . You will have one chance , Jake . How will I know if he chooses me ? He will try to kill you . Outstanding . Let 's dance . That moron 's going to die . Do n't be afraid , warrior . Make the bond ! No ! Jake ! Shahaylu , Jake . Shahaylu ! Stop ! Yeah , that 's right . You 're mine . Huh ? First flight seals the bond . You cannot wait . Think , Fly ! - Fly ? God damn ! Oh , shit ! Shut up and fly straight ! That 's it . Bank left ! Level out ! That 's it . Jakesully ! Hey ! Let 's go ! Yeah , baby , I got this ! Oh , shit ! I may not be much of a horse guy , but I was born to do this . Yeah ! I came like this . This you . Yeah , yeah . I turn . I feel the wind . I turn very strong . Look , yeah , see , I banked so hard ... The Tree of Souls . It 's their most sacred place . See the Flux Vortex in these false color images ? Yeah , that 's what messes up my instruments . There is something really interesting going on in there biologically . I would die to get samples . Outsiders are strictly forbidden . You lucky swine . Hell , yeah ! Hell , yeah ! I was a stone-cold aerial hunter . Death from above . Only problem is , you 're not the only one . Dive ! Go , go ! Follow me ! Our guys call it a Great Leonopteryx . It is Toruk . Last Shadow . Yeah , right . It 's the last one you ever see . My grandfather 's grandfather was Toruk Macto . Rider of Last Shadow . He rode this ? Toruk chose him . It has only happened five times since the time of the First Songs . That 's a long time . Yes . Toruk Macto was mighty . He brought the clans together in a time of great sorrow . All Na 'vi people know the story . Everything is backwards now . Like out there is the true world and in here is the dream . It 's hard to believe it 's only been three months . I can barely remember my old life . I do n't know who I am anymore . Have n't gotten lost in the woods , have you ? Your last report was more than two weeks ago . I 'm starting to doubt your resolve ! The way I see it , it 's time to terminate the mission . No , I can do this . You already have . You give me good , usable intel . This Tree of Souls place . Yeah , I got them by the balls with that when this turns into a shit fight which it will . Yeah . Now it 's time to come in . By the way , you gonna get your legs back . Yeah . I got your corporate approval . It 's a done deal . Gonna have you on a shuttle tonight . I 'm a man of my word . I gotta finish this . There 's one more thing . Ceremony . It 's the final stage of becoming a man . If I do it , I 'm one of them . And they 'll trust me . And I can negotiate the terms of their relocation . Well , then , you 'd better get it done , Corporal . The Na 'vi say that every person is born twice . The second time is when you earn your place among The People forever . You are now a son of the Omaticaya . You are part of The People . Come . Come . This is a place for prayers to be heard . And sometimes answered . We call these trees Utraya Mokri . The Tree of Voices . The voices of our ancestors . I can hear them . They live , Jake , within Eywa . You are Omaticaya now . You may make your bow from the wood of Hometree . And you may choose a woman . We have many fine women . Ninat is the best singer . But I do n't want Ninat . Beyral is a good hunter . Yeah , she is a good hunter . I 've already chosen . But this woman must also choose me . She already has . I am with you now , Jake . We are mated for life . What the hell are you doing , Jake ? Ma Jake ! Do n't forget your phase integration . Jake ! No , no , the middle button . You gotta eat something . Yeah , there you go . Jake ! Jake . Wake up ! Jake , please ! Do n't make me force-feed a cripple . Grace , I do n't want ... Hey ! Jake ! Okay . Here . I 'm done . Let 's go . And when was the last time you took a shower ? I do n't need a shower . Jesus , Marine . Jake ! Jake ! Wake up ! Jake ! Wake up ! Hey ! Stop ! Stop ! Jake ! Go back , stop ! Hey , boss . Hey ! What ? I got a native doing the funky chicken here . He 's blocking my blade . Well , keep going . He 'll move . These people have to learn that we do n't stop . Come on , go , go , go . Stop ! Hey ! Go ! Go ! There , see ? He moved . Dude , dude . Whoa , dude ! Dude , no ! I 'm blind . Jake ! Neytiri ! Here , come on ! Freeze it right there . Scale up . Enhance . Son of a bitch . Unbelievable . Get me a pilot . Yes , sir . Tsu 'tey will lead the war party . Stop please ! This will only make it worse . You do not speak here ! We will strike them in the heart . Tsu 'tey ! Do n't do this . You ! Listen . Brother ... You mated with this woman ? Oh , shit . Is this true ? We are mated before Eywa . It is done . Brother , please . Do not attack the Sky People . Many Omaticaya will die if you do . You are not my brother ! And I am not your enemy ! The enemy is out there , and they are very powerful ! Go ! Go ! Go ! I can talk to them . No more talk . Tsu 'tey ! I am Omaticaya . I am one of you . And I have the right to speak . I have something to say ... to all of you . The words are like stones in my heart . Sir , I 'm sorry . No , no , no ! Hold on ! You ca n't interrupt a link in progress ! It 's very dangerous ! Grace ! Oh , no . Wait ! Stay down , sir . Okay . Look ... I was sent here to ... You see ? It is a demon in a false body . Are you out of your goddamn mind ? You crossed the line . Wheel this meat out of here . Jake ! What the hell is going on here ? You let me down , son . So , what , you find yourself some local tail and you just completely forget what team you 're playing for ? Parker , there is time to salvage the situation . Parker ... Shut your pie hole ! Or what , Ranger Rick ? You gonna shoot me ? I could do that . You need to muzzle your dog . Yeah , can we just take this down a couple of notches , please ? You say you want to keep your people alive ? You start by listening to her . Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya in a way you ca n't imagine . You know what ? You throw a stick in the air around here , it 's gonna land on some sacred fern , for Christ 's sake ! I 'm not talking about some kind of pagan voodoo here . I 'm talking about something real , something measurable in the biology of the forest . Something measurable in the biology of the forest . Which is what , exactly ? What we think we know is that there is some kind of electrochemical communication between the roots of the trees , like the synapses between neurons . And each tree has ten-to-the-fourth connections to the trees around it . And there are ten-to-the-twelfth trees on Pandora . Which is a lot , I 'm guessing . It 's more connections than the human brain . Get it ? It 's a network . It 's a global network , and the Na 'vi can access it . They can upload and download data . Memories . At sites like the one you just destroyed . Yes ! What the hell have you people been smoking out there ? They 're just goddamn trees ! You need to wake up , Parker . No . You need to wake up . The wealth of this world is n't in the ground . It 's all around us . The Na 'vi know that , and they are fighting to defend it . If you want to share this world with them , you need to understand them . I 'd say we understand them just fine , thanks to Jake here . Hey , Doc , come take a look . They 're not gonna give up their home . They 're not gonna make a deal . For what ? Lite beer ? And blue jeans ? There 's nothing that we have that they want . Everything they sent me out here to do is a waste of time . They 're never gonna leave Hometree . So , since a deal ca n't be made , I guess things get real simple . Jake , thanks . I 'm getting all emotional . I might just give you a big wet kiss . Talk to me , Lyle . It looks like they hit it with banshees first . See the angle 's steep ? They set the ampsuit on fire . Driver 's toast . The rest of the squad ? Six bodies . That 's all of them . The equipment 's totaled . Jesus Christ . I 'll do it with minimal casualties to the indigenous . I 'll drive them out with gas first . It 'll be humane . More or less . All right , let 's pull the trigger . Come on , people . Let 's get it packed , let 's go . You know , they never even wanted us to succeed . They bulldozed a sacred site on purpose to trigger a response . Just fabricating this war to get what they want . This is how it 's done . When people are sitting on shit that you want , you make them your enemy . Then you 're justified in taking it . Quaritch is rolling the gunships . He 's gonna hit Hometree . My God . Dr . Augustine ! You cannot be up here ! Back off ! Parker . Wait . Stop . These are people you 're about to ... No . No , no , no , no . I said back off ! They 're fly-bitten savages that live in a tree ! All right ? Look around ! I do n't know about you , but I see a lot of trees ! They can move ! Can you guys just please ... Yes , sir . There are families in there . There are children . Babies . Are you gonna kill children ? You do n't want that kind of blood on your hands . Believe me . Just let me try to talk them out . They trust me . Calibrate fast . We 're going in , right now . Calibrating three and four . Run sequence . Initiating . Thirty seconds . Listen to me . You 've got one hour . Unless you want your girlfriend in there when the ax comes down , you get them to evacuate . One hour . Father ! Mother ! Eytukan , I have something to say . Listen ! Speak , Jakesully . A great evil is upon us ... The Sky People are coming ... to destroy Hometree . Look , tell them they 're gonna be here soon . You have to leave , or you 're gonna die . Are you certain of this ? Look , they sent me here to learn your ways so one day I could bring this message and that you would believe it . What are you saying , Jake ? You knew this would happen ? Yes . Look , at first it was just orders , and then everything changed . Okay ? I fell in love . I fell in love with the forest and with the Omaticaya people . And with you . I trusted you . With you . With you . I trusted you ! Trust me now , please . You will never be one of The People ! I should n't have ... We tried to stop them ! Neytiri , please ! Please . Bind them . Leave now ! You have to go . They 're coming ! Time on target , one mike . Copy . We have a visual . Roger that . Stay on heading 030 . Roger , 030 . Run to the forest ! They 're coming ! They will destroy this place . Neytiri , you must go now ! Run to the forest ! Run ! Run ! Run ! Have no fear . No ! God damn it , run ! Take the ikran ... attack from above . That is one big damn tree . Well , well , well . I 'd say diplomacy has failed . All right , people , let 's get this done ! I want every gas round you got right in the front door . Roger . CS . 40 's going hot . Fire . Firing . Bingo . Mighty good shooting , ace . Sir , they 've opened fire . You 've got to be kidding me ! These dumb bastards ai n't getting the message . All right , let 's turn up the heat . Switch incendiaries ! Switching incendiaries . Fire . No ! Get everyone to the forest . And that 's how you scatter the roaches . Neytiri ! We gotta move ! He 's gonna blow the columns ! My God ! Mo 'at ! No ! Lf you are one of us , help us . All call signs , switch missiles . Give me HE 's at the base of the west columns . This way ! Rider section , switch missiles . One 's good . Two 's rocks up . Three 's up . Yeah , baby , get some ! Charlie Oscar , Gunrunner standing by . Bring it down . Cleared hot . Come on , Grace , move ! Down ! Head down ! Come on , come on ! Down ! Solid hits . Solid rocks on target . Screw this . Hey ! What the hell are you doing ? I did n't sign up for this shit ! Repeat . Ripple fire . Go ! Go ! Go ! No , no , get back ! Back ! Come on ! Come on , move ! Move ! That 's good work , people . First round 's on me tonight . Let 's boogie . Dragon coming left , heading home . Gunrunner coming left . Thunder copies . Rider section copies . Father ! Daughter ... take ... my ... bow . Protect The People . Neytiri ! I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Get away . Get away ! Get away from here ! Never come back ! Pull the plug . No , you ca n't do that ! You ca n't do that ! Calm down ! Calm down ! No ! Please ! I was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace . Sooner or later , though , you always have to wake up . Let 's go ! Put him down ! You murderer ! What 's going on , brother ? Long time no see . Hey . Personally , I do n't feel these tree-hugging traitors deserve steak . They get steak ? That 's bullshit . Let me see that . Yeah . You know what that is . Down . Trudy ! All the way down . Max ! Trudy , fire up the ship ! Go ! Here . Clear . Come on . Here you go . Max , stay here . I need someone on the inside I can trust . Okay . Go . Clear . Come on , baby . Colonel ? Sir ? I got a situation here . It 's Samson 1-6 . Unauthorized engine start . Three ! Come on ! Mask on ! Gas , gas , gas ! I 'm taking fire ! Let 's go ! Grab my hand ! Come on , we 're in . Let 's go ! Come on , let 's go ! Let 's go , go ! Colonel ! Yeah ! Yeah ! All right ! Yes ! Crap . Everybody all right back there ? Oh , yeah , baby ! Norm , you good ? Yeah ! This is gonna ruin my whole day . Grace is hit ! What ? Get the trauma kit . Trauma kit ! Keep the pressure on , Grace . Trauma kit 's forward , on the bulkhead . Hang on , Grace . Does n't matter . It 's fine . You 're good to go . Take it up ! Hold on . I 'm pulling pitch . You 're clear ! Just keep going north . Get us deep in the mountains . Copy that . Norm , you all good up there ? Yep ! Still here . Well , at least they ca n't track us up here . Not this far into the Vortex . It 's strongest at the Tree of Souls , right ? Yeah . Good . 'Cause that 's where we 're going . Ouch . You big baby . We 're moving . I 'm gonna get you some help , Grace . I 'm a scientist , remember ? I do n't believe in fairy tales . The People can help you . I know it . Why would they help us ? The People say Eywa will provide . With no home , no hope , there was only one place they could go . Link 's running . What 's the plan here , Jake ? There 's no plan . Tsu 'tey is Olo 'eyktan now . He 's not gonna let you near that place . I gotta try . Launching . Outcast . Betrayer . Alien . I was in the place the eye does not see . I needed their help , and they needed mine . But to ever face them again , I was gonna have to take it to a whole new level . Sometimes your whole life boils down to one insane move . There 's something we gotta do . You 're not gonna like it . The way I had it figured , Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky . Nothing attacks him . Easy , boy . So why would he ever look up ? But that was just a theory . Toruk Macto ? I See you . I See you . I was afraid , Jake . For my people . I 'm not anymore . Tsu 'tey , son of Ateyo ... I stand before you ... ready to serve the Omaticaya people . You are Olo 'eyktan , and you are a great warrior . I ca n't do this without you . Toruk Macto , I will fly with you . My friend is dying . Grace is dying . I beg the help of Eywa . Look where we are , Grace . I need to take some samples . The Great Mother may choose to save all that she is in this body . Is that possible ? She must pass through the eye of Eywa and return . But , Jakesully , she is very weak . Hang on , Grace . They 're gonna fix you up . Hear us please , All Mother . Eywa , help her . Take this spirit into you ... and breathe her back to us . Let her walk among us ... as one of The People . Jake . Grace . I 'm with her , Jake . She 's real ! Grace ? Grace , please . Grace ! What 's happening ? What 's happening ? Grace ! Grace ! What 's happening ? Did it work ? Her wounds were too great . It was not enough time . She is with Eywa now . With your permission , I will speak now . You would honor me by translating . The Sky People have sent us a message that they can take whatever they want and no one can stop them . Well , we will send them a message . You ride out as fast as the wind can carry you . You tell the other clans to come . You tell them Toruk Macto calls to them . And you fly now with me ! My brothers ! Sisters ! And we will show the Sky People that they cannot take whatever they want , and that this , this is our land ! Yah ! Yah ! Yah ! We rode out to the four winds . To the horse clans of the plain . Back to the stars ! To the ikran people ofthe Eastern Sea . For our children 's children ! When Toruk Macto called them , they came . Yah ! Everyone on this base , every one of you , is fighting for survival . That 's a fact ! There 's an aboriginal horde out there massing for an attack . Now , these orbital images tell me that the hostiles ' numbers have gone from a few hundred to well over 2 , 000 in one day . And more are pouring in . In a week 's time , there could be 20 , 000 of them . At that point , they will overrun our perimeter . Well , that 's not gonna happen ! Our only security lies in pre-emptive attack . We will fight terror with terror . Now , the hostiles believe that this mountain stronghold of theirs is protected by their ... Their deity . And when we destroy it , we will blast a crater in their racial memory so deep that they wo n't come within 1 , 000 klicks of this place ever again . And that , too , is a fact . Yeah ! Yeah . Jake , it 's crazy here . It 's full mobilization . They 're rigging the shuttle as a bomber . They 've got these huge pallets of mine explosives . It 's for some kind of shock-and-awe campaign . Fricking daisy cutters ! Quaritch has taken over . He 's rolling , and there 's no stopping him . When ? 0600 tomorrow . Max ! Max ! I gotta go . We 're screwed ! And I was hoping for some sort of tactical plan that did n't involve martyrdom . We 're going up against gunships with bows and arrows . I have 15 clans out there . That 's over 2 , 000 warriors . Now , we know these mountains . We fly them . You fly them . They do n't . Their instruments wo n't work up here . Missile tracking wo n't work . They 'll have to fire a line of sight . If they bring the fight to us , then we have the home-field advantage . You know he 's gonna commit that bomber straight to the Tree of Souls . Yeah , I know . If they get to the Tree of Souls , it 's over . That 's their direct line to Eywa , their ancestors . It 'll destroy them . Then I guess we 'd better stop him . I 'm probably just talking to a tree right now . But if you 're there , I need to give you a heads-up . If Grace is with you , look into her memories . See the world we come from . There 's no green there . They killed their Mother . And they 're gonna do the same here . More Sky People are gonna come . They 're gonna come like a rain that never ends . Unless we stop them . Look , you chose me for something . I will stand and fight . You know I will . But I need a little help here . Our Great Mother does not take sides , Jake . She protects only the balance of life . It was worth a try . Yeah ! Yeah ! That 's what I 'm talking about ! Yeah ! Yeah ! That 's what I 'm talking about , man ! This is Group Leader . We are entering the Flux Vortex . Switch to manual flight mode . Copy . Manual flight mode . This is Papa Dragon . I want this mission high and tight . I want to be home for dinner . Suit Team , go .

Drop ! Go , go , go , go ! Brace ! It 's Sully . Mask on ! Breach alarm ! Come on . Come to papa . Give it up , Quaritch ! It 's all over . Nothing 's over while I 'm breathing . I kind of hoped you 'd say that . Come on ! Hey , Sully , how 's it feel to betray your own race ? You think you 're one of them ? Time to wake up . Jake ? Jake . Jake . Jake ! Ma Jake ! I See you . I See you . I See you , Brother . Are The People safe ? They 're safe . I ca n't ... I cannot lead The People . You must lead them ... Jakesully . I 'm not officer material . It is decided . Now ... do the duty of Olo 'eyktan . I will not kill you . It is the way ! And it is good . I will be remembered . I fought ... with Toruk Macto ! And we were brothers . And he ... was my last shadow . The aliens went back to their dying world . Only a few were chosen to stay . The time of great sorrow was ending . Toruk Macto was no longer needed . Well , I guess this is my last video log . 'Cause whatever happens tonight , either way , I 'm ... I 'm not gonna be coming back to this place . Well , I guess I 'd better go . Yeah , I do n't want to be late for my own party . Yeah , it 's my birthday , after all . This is Jake Sully signing off . It is an extremely common mistake , people think the writer 's imagination is always at work , that he 's constantly inventing an endless supply of incidents and episodes , that he simply dreams up his stories out of thin air . In point of fact , the opposite is true . Once the public knows you 're a writer , they bring the characters and events to you and as long as you maintain your ability to look and to carefully listen , these stories will continue to ... Stop it . Stop it ! Don 't ! Don 't do it ! Uh , will continue to seek you out over your lifetime . To him who has often told the tales of others , many tales will be told . Sorry . It 's all right . The incidents that follow were described to me exactly as I present them here and in a wholly unexpected way . A number of years ago , while suffering from a mild case of " Scribe 's Fever , " a form of neurasthenia common among the intelligentsia of that time , I decided to spend the month of August in the spa town of Nebelsbad below the Alpine Sudetenwaltz , and had taken up rooms in the Grand Budapest , a picturesque , elaborate , and once widely celebrated establishment . I expect some of you will know it . YOUNG WRITER : It was off season and , by that time , decidedly out of fashion , and it had already begun its descent into shabbiness and eventual demolition . What few guests we were had quickly come to recognize one another by sight as the only living souls residing in the vast establishment , although I do not believe any acquaintance among our number had proceeded beyond the polite nods we exchanged as we passed in the Palm Court , in the Arabian baths , and on board the Colonnade Funicular . We were a very reserved group , it seemed , and , without exception , solitary . Perhaps as a result of this general silence , I had established a casual and bantering familiarity with the hotel 's concierge , a West- continental known only as Monsieur Jean , who struck one as being , at once , both lazy and , really , quite accommodating . I expect he was not well paid . In any case , one evening , as I stood conferring elbow- to- elbow with Monsieur Jean , as had become my habit , I noticed a new presence in our company . A small , elderly man , smartly dressed , with an exceptionally lively , intelligent face and an immediately perceptible air of sadness . He was , like the rest of us , alone , but also , I must say , he was the first that struck one as being deeply and truly lonely . A symptom of my own medical condition as well . Who 's this interesting old fellow ? I inquired of Monsieur Jean . To my surprise , he was distinctly taken aback . Don 't you know ? He asked . Don 't you recognize him ? He did look familiar . That 's Mr . Moustafa himself . He arrived earlier this morning . This name will no doubt be familiar to the more seasoned persons among you . Mr . Zero Moustafa was at one time the richest man in Zubrowka , and was still indeed the owner of the Grand Budapest . He often comes and stays a week or more , three times a year at least , but never in the season . Monsieur Jean signaled to me and I leaned closer . I' ll tell you a secret . He takes only a single- bed sleeping room without a bath in the rear corner of the top floor and it 's smaller than the service elevator ! It was well known , Zero Moustafa had purchased and famously inhabited some of the most lavish castles and palazzos on the continent . Yet here , in his own nearly empty hotel , he occupied a servant 's quarters ? At that moment , the curtain rose on a parenthetical , domestic drama ... Shit . Which required the immediate and complete attention of Monsieur Jean , but , frankly , did not hold mine for long . However , this premature intermission in the story of the curious , old man had left me , as the expression goes , " gespannt wie ein Flitzebogen , " that is , on the edge of my seat , where I remained throughout the next morning , until , in what I have found to be its mysterious and utterly reliable fashion , fate , once again , intervened on my behalf . MR . MOUSTAFA : I admire your work . I beg your pardon ? I said , I know and admire your wonderful work . Thank you most kindly , sir . Did Monsieur Jean have a word or two to share with you about the aged proprietor of this establishment ? I must confess , I did myself inquire about you . He 's perfectly capable , of course , Monsieur Jean but we can 't claim he 's a first , or , in earnest , even second- rate concierge . But there it is . Times have changed . The thermal baths are very beautiful . They were in their first condition . It couldn 't be maintained , of course . Too decadent for current tastes . But I love it all just the same , this enchanting old ruin . How did you come to buy it , if I may ask ? The Grand Budapest . I didn 't . If you 're not merely being polite , and you must tell me if that 's the case , but if it genuinely does interest you , may I invite you to dine with me tonight , and it will be my pleasure and , indeed , my privilege to tell you " my story . " Such as it is . Two ducks roasted with olives . Rabbit , salad ? Mmm . Pouilly- Jouvet '52 , plus a split of the brut . That should provide us ample time if I commence promptly . By all means . Well , it begins , as it must , with our mutual friend 's predecessor . The beloved , original concierge of The Grand Budapest . It begins , of course , with ... Bring the table to the window . Yes , Monsieur Gustave . Bring the tray to the table . Right away , Monsieur Gustave . Right there . Have those been brushed and blocked ? Of course , Monsieur Gustave . Pack them in the hat boxes . Is that from Oberstdorf & Company ? I believe so , Monsieur Gustave . Second trunk . Who has the tickets ? I do , Monsieur Gustave . Give them to me . These are in order . Wait in the corner . I 'm not leaving . I beg your pardon ? I 'm not leaving . Why not ? I 'm frightened . Of what ? I fear this may be the last time we ever see each other . Why on earth would that be the case ? Well , I can 't put it into words , but I feel it . For goodness sake , there 's no reason for you to leave us if you 'd ... Come with me . To fucking Lutz ? Please . Give me your hand . You 've nothing to fear . You 're always anxious before you travel . I admit , you appear to be suffering a more acute attack on this occasion . But , truly and honestly ... Oh , dear God . What have you done to your fingernails ? I beg your pardon ? This diabolical varnish . The color is completely wrong . Don 't you like it ? It 's not that I don 't like it . I am physically repulsed . Perhaps this will soothe you . What ? Don 't recite . Just listen to the words . Hush . Please . Not now . " While questing once in noble wood of gray , medieval pine , " I came upon a tomb , rain- slick 'd , rubbed- cool , ethereal , " ' its inscription long- vanished , " yet still within its melancholy fissures ... " MADAME D . : Will you light a candle for me , please ? In the sacristy of Santa Maria ? GUSTAVE H : I' ll see to it myself immediately . Remember , I 'm always with you . I love you . I love you . It 's quite a thing winning the loyalty of a woman like that for 19 consecutive seasons . Um ... Yes , sir . She 's very fond of me , you know . Yes , sir . But I' ve never seen her like that before . No , sir . She was shaking like a shitting dog . Truly . Run to the cathedral of Santa Maria in Brucknerplatz . Buy one of the plain , half- length candles and take back four Klubecks in change . Light it in the sacristy , say a brief rosary then go to Mendl 's and get me a courtesan au chocolat . If there 's any money left , give it to the crippled shoe- shine boy . Right away , sir . Hold it . Who are you ? I 'm Zero , sir . The new Lobby Boy . Zero , you say ? Yes , sir . I' ve never heard of you , never laid eyes on you . Who hired you ? Mr . Mosher , sir . Mr . Mosher ! Yes , Monsieur Gustave ? Am I to understand you 've surreptitiously hired this young man in the position of a Lobby Boy ? He 's been engaged for a trial period , pending your approval , of course . Uh ... Perhaps , yes . Thank you , Mr . Mosher . You 're most welcome , Monsieur Gustave . You 're now going to be officially interviewed . Should I go and light the candle first , sir ? What ? No . Experience ? Hotel Kinski , Kitchen Boy , six months . Hotel Berlitz , Mop and Broom Boy , three months . Before that I was a Skillet Scrubber ... Experience , zero . Thank you again , Monsieur Gustave . Straighten that cap , Anatole . The pleasure 's mine , Herr Schneider . The strap 's busted . These are not acceptable . I fully agree . Education ? I studied reading and spelling . I started my primary school . I almost ... Education , zero . Now it 's exploded . Good morning , Cicero . Call the goddamn plumber ! This afternoon , Monsieur Gustave ? Without fail , Frau Liebling . What in hell is this ? Not now . Family ? Zero . Six , Igor . Why do you want to be a Lobby Boy ? Well , who wouldn 't , at the Grand Budapest , sir ? It 's an institution . Very good . A thousand Klubecks . My goodness . Were you ever a Lobby Boy , sir ? What do you think ? Well , I suppose you 'd have to start somewhere ... Go and light the goddamn candle . Yes , sir . MR . MOUSTAFA : And so , my life began . Junior Lobby Boy in- training , Grand Budapest Hotel , under the strict command of Monsieur Gustave H . I became his pupil , and he was to be my counselor and guardian . GUSTAVE H : What is a Lobby Boy ? A Lobby Boy 's completely invisible , yet always in sight . A Lobby Boy remembers what people hate . A Lobby Boy anticipates the client 's needs before the needs are needed . A Lobby Boy is , above all , discreet to a fault . Our guests know their deepest secrets , some of which are , frankly , rather unseemly , will go with us to our graves . So keep your mouth shut , Zero . Yes , sir . That 's all for now . MR . MOUSTAFA : I began to realize that many of the hotel 's most valued and distinguished guests came for him . It seemed to be an essential part of his duties ... Ah ! But I believe it was also his pleasure . The requirements were always the same . They had to be rich , old , insecure , vain , superficial , blonde , needy . Why blonde ? Because they all were . He was , by the way , the most liberally perfumed man I had ever encountered . The scent announced his approach from a great distance and lingered for many minutes after he was gone . I worked six days each week plus a half- day Sunday , 5 : 00 AM until just after midnight . Our meals were small but frequent , for stamina . Two breakfasts , two lunches and a late supper . Monsieur Gustave also delivered a nightly sermon . Rudeness is merely the expression of fear . People fear they won 't get what they want . The most dreadful and unattractive person only needs to be loved , and they will open up like a flower . I am reminded of a verse , " The painter 's brush touched the inchoate face " by ends of nimble bristles " and with their blush of first color , " rendered her lifeless cheek living . " MR . MOUSTAFA : His own dinner , he took alone in his room . The identity of the owner of the hotel was unknown to all of us . Each month , his emissary , known as Deputy Kovacs , arrived to review the books and convey messages on behalf of the mysterious proprietor . On these occasions , Monsieur Gustave and our business manager , Herr Becker , met with him in private consultation above Reception . This was also when I met Agatha , but we won 't discuss that . What do you want ? Look . GUSTAVE H : Dear God . I 'm terribly sorry , sir . We must go to her . We must ? Tout de suite . She needs me , and I need you to help me with my bags and so on . How fast can you pack ? Five minutes . Do it . And bring a bottle of the Pouilly- Jouvet '26 in an ice bucket with two glasses so we don 't have to drink the cat piss they serve in the dining car . I blame myself . She tried to tell me she had a premonition . I didn 't listen . All of Lutz will be dressed in black , except her own ghastly , deceitful children whom she loathed and couldn 't bear to kiss hello . They 'll be dancing like gypsies . There 's really no point in doing anything in life , because it 's all over in the blink of an eye ... And , the next thing you know , rigor mortis sets in . Oh , how the good die young . With any luck , she 's left a few Klubecks for your old friend , but one never knows until the ink is dry on the death certificate . She was dynamite in the sack , by the way . She was 84 , Monsieur Gustave . I' ve had older . When you 're young , it 's all fillet steak , but as the years go by , you have to move on to the cheaper cuts , which is fine with me , because I like those . More flavorful , or so they say . Why are we stopping at a barley field ? Well , hello there , chaps . Documents , please . With pleasure . It 's not a very flattering portrait , I 'm afraid . I was once considered a great beauty . What does the " F " stand for ? Fritz ? Franz ? Franz . I knew it ! He 's making a funny face . That 's a Migratory Visa with Stage Three Worker Status , Franz , darling . He 's with me . Come outside , please . Now , wait a minute . Sit down , Zero . His papers are in order . I cross- referenced them myself with the Bureau of Labor and Servitude . You can 't arrest him simply because he 's a bloody immigrant . He hasn 't done anything wrong . Stop it , damn you ! Never mind , Monsieur Gustave ! Let them proceed ! GUSTAVE H : Ow ! That hurts ! You filthy , goddamn , pock- marked , fascist assholes ! Take your hands off my Lobby Boy ! What 's the problem ? This is outrageous . The young man works for me at the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad . Monsieur Gustave ? My name is Henckels . I 'm the son of Dr . and Mrs . Wolfgang Henckels- Bergersdörfer . Do you remember me ? I know exactly who you are . It 's uncanny . You 're little Albert . I 'm terribly embarrassed . Release them . Release them . Hmm . Your colleague is stateless . He 'll need to apply for a revised Special Transit Permit , which at this point may be very difficult to acquire . Take this . It 's temporary but it 's the best I can offer , I 'm afraid . And how 's your wonderful mother ? She 's very well , thank you . I adore her . Send my love . I will . Your companion was very kind to me when I was a lonely little boy . My men and I apologize for disturbing you . I beg your pardon , sir . You see ? There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity . Indeed , that 's what we provide in our own modest , humble , insignificant ... Oh , fuck it . Where is she , Clotilde ? Take me to her . You 're looking so well , darling . You really are . They 've done a marvelous job . I don 't know what sort of cream they 've put on you down at the morgue , but I want some . Honestly , you look better than you have in years . You look like you 're alive . Oh , you changed it after all . It 's perfect . Clotilde ? Oui , Monsieur Gustave ? A glass of chilled water with no ice , please . Yes . M . Gustave ... and . also . M . Serge would like to speak with you privately in his office . please . Oh . All right , then . I shan 't be long , darling . MR . MOUSTAFA : We were escorted through a green baize door , down a narrow service corridor and into the butler 's pantry . A moment later , the kitchen passage swung open and a small servant dressed in white jolted into the room . I' ve never forgotten the look on that man 's face . What the devil is going on ? I , myself , had never set foot inside a house of this kind in my life . I understood very little about the events that were to follow . But , eventually , I came to recognize , when the destiny of a great fortune is at stake , men 's greed spreads like a poison in the bloodstream . Uncles , nephews , cousins , in- laws of increasingly tenuous connection . The old woman 's most distant relations had come foraging out of the woodwork . At the head of this congregation , it was a disorienting coincidence , we discovered our own Deputy Kovacs , himself an important attorney , of course . He was the executor of the dead widow 's estate . This is Madame D 's last will and testament . It consists of a general tontine drawn up before the event of her husband 's death 46 years ago , in combination with 635 amendments , notations , corrections , and letters of wishes executed during the subsequent decades . The ultimate legality of this accumulation requires further analysis , but in the opinion of this office , it was Madame D 's intention that control of the vast bulk of her estate should be transferred , forthwith , to her son , Dmitri , with special allowances for his sisters , Marguerite , Laetizia , and Carolina , and minor gifts for various members of the extended family as shown in the List of Recipients , which I will elucidate in due course . However . An additional codicil , delivered into my possession by post only this morning , and , by all indications , sent by Madame D during the last hours of her life , contains an amendment to the original certificate , which , as prescribed by law , I will read to you now . The authenticity of this document has not yet been confirmed by the presiding magistrate , so I ask that all parties be patient and refrain from comment until such time as our investigations can be completed . " To my esteemed friend who comforted me in my later years " and brought sunshine into the life of an old woman " who thought that she would never be happy again . " Monsieur Gustave H , " I bequeath , bestow and devise , free of all taxation " and with full and absolute fiduciary entitlement , " the painting known as Boy with Apple ... Wow ! " ... by Johannes van Hoytl ... " I can 't believe it . " ... the younger ... " What ? " ... which gave us both so much pleasure . " The van Hoytl ? Tax- free ? Can she do that ? Who 's Gustave H ? I 'm afraid that 's me , darling . That fucking faggot ! He 's a concierge . What are you doing here ? I' ve come to pay my respects to a great woman whom I loved . This man is an intruder in my home ! It 's not yours yet , Dmitri . Only when probate is granted , and the Deed of Entitlement ... You 're not getting Boy with Apple , you goddamn little fruit ! How 's that supposed to make me feel ? Call the police . We 're pressing charges . This criminal has plagued my family for nearly 20 years . He 's a ruthless adventurer and a con- artist who preys on mentally feeble , sick old ladies , and he probably fucks them , too ! I go to bed with all my friends . Where 's Céline ? What ? She 's dead . We 're reading her will . Oh , yes , yes , of course . If I learn you ever once laid a finger on my mother 's body , living or dead , I swear to God , I' ll out your throat ! You hear me ? I thought I was supposed to be a fucking faggot . You are , but you 're bisexual . Let 's change the subject . I 'm leaving . Wait here quietly . please . That picture , Boy with Apple , is priceless . Understand ? Congratulations , Monsieur Gustave ! They 're going to fight me for the son of a bitch . Is it very beautiful ? Beyond description . " E' en the most gifted bard 's rhyme can only sing " but to the lack of her and all she isn 't ! " His tongue doth ... " Can I see it ? I don 't see why not . This is van Hoytl 's exquisite portrayal of a beautiful boy on the cusp of manhood . Blond , smooth . Skin as white as that milk . Of impeccable provenance . One of the last in private hands , and unquestionably , the best . It 's a masterpiece . The rest of this shit is worthless junk . M . Gustave ? Can I help you ? Yes . Serge . You can wrap this up . please . Wrap up ... Wrap up ... " Boy With Apple " ? What did you want to tell me , before ? I think I cannot say right now . Write me tomorrow . Lutzbahn Station ! I' ll never part with it . It reminded her of me . It will remind me of her . Always . I' ll die with this picture above my bed . See the resemblance ? Oh , yes . Actually , we should sell it . Sooner rather than later , in case they try to steal it back . Plus , something about those lunatic foot- soldiers on the express ... This could be a tricky war and a long dry spell in the hotel trade . For all we know , they could board us up tomorrow . Let 's make a solemn blood- pact . We 'll contact the black market and liquidate Boy with Apple by the end of the week , then leave the country and lay low somewhere along the Maltese Riviera until the troubles blow over and we resume our posts . In exchange for your help , your loyalty and your services as my personal valet , I pledge to you 1 . 5 % of the net sale price . 1 . 5 ? Plus room and board . Could we make it 10 ? 10 ? Are you joking ? That 's more than I 'd pay an actual dealer , and you wouldn 't know Chiaroscuro from chicken giblets . No , 1 . 5 is correct . But I' ll tell you what , if I die first , and I most certainly will , you will be my sole heir . There 's not much in the kitty except a set of ivory- backed hairbrushes and my library of romantic poetry , but when the time comes , these will be yours , along with whatever we haven 't already spent on whores and whiskey . This is our sacred bond . I' ll draw it up right now . I , Monsieur Gustave H , being of relatively sound mind and body , on this day , the 19th of October , in the year of our Lord 1932 ... MR . MOUSTAFA : He never told me where he came from . I never asked who his family had been . Excuse me . Uh- huh ? The police are here . They asked for you . Tell them I' ll be right down . Okay . Have you ever been questioned by the authorities ? Yes , on one occasion I was arrested and tortured by the rebel militia after the Desert Uprising . You know the drill , then . Zip it . Of course . You 've never heard the word " van Hoytl " in your life . Okay , let 's go . How may we serve you , gentlemen ? Ah , Inspector Henckels . " By order of the Commissioner of Police , Zubrowka Province , " I hereby place you under arrest for the murder " of Madame Céline Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis . " I knew there was something fishy . We never got the cause of death . She 's been murdered and you think I did it . HENCKELS : Hey ! Stop ! What happened ? What happened , my dear Zero , is I beat the living shit out of a sniveling little runt called Pinky Bandinski who had the gall to question my virility , because if there 's one thing we 've learned from penny dreadfuls , it 's that , when you find yourself in a place like this , you must never be a candy- ass . You 've got to prove yourself from Day One . You 've got to win their respect . You should take a long look at his ugly mug this morning . He 's , actually , become a dear friend . You 'll meet him , I hope . So . You 've talked to Kovacs ? I saw him last night in secret . He made me take an oath on a Bible I wouldn 't tell a soul . You 're supposed to also . I' ll do that later . He suspects you 're innocent . Of course he does . What 's the charge ? In the small hours of the evening of 19 October , an individual well- known to the house and staff , a Monsieur Gustave H , did arrive at the Desgoffe und Taxis residence in Lutz and entered by the rear service alley , alerting no one to his presence , and did then proceed by way of back stairs and servants' passage , to deliver himself into the private chambers of Madame D . There is no evidence to indicate whether this visit had been pre- arranged with her or not . The next morning Madame D was found dead by strychnine poisoning . Monsieur Gustave was not observed on the premises again until , of course , 24 hours later . The identity of his accusers is made clear in this notarized deposition . They include , essentially , all members of the extended family , but the key witness who actually ostensibly saw the alleged events appears to have fled the jurisdiction . His whereabouts are currently unknown , but he 's being sought and pursued by the relevant authorities . Who is he ? Serge ? I 'm afraid so . That little prick . No , I don 't believe it . They put him up to it . I' ve been dropped into a nest of vipers . You have an alibi ? Of course , but she 's married to the Duke of Westphalia . I can 't allow her name to get mixed- up in all this monkey business . Your life may be at stake . I know , but the bitch legged it . She 's already on board the Queen Nasstasja halfway to Dutch Tanganyika . Don 't give up . MR . MOUSTAFA : The details of the conspiracy , now a matter of public record , were , at that time , impossible for us to apprehend . I 'm looking for Serge X , a young man in the service of my employer , the family Desgoffe und Taxis of Schloss Lutz . Yes , sir ? You 're his sister ? Yes , sir . Seen him lately ? No , sir . No , sir ? No , sir . I need to find him right away , for his own safety and everybody else 's . If he shows up ... Yes , sir ? Tell him Jopling says , " Come home . " MR . MOUSTAFA : But one thing was certain , the Desgoffe und Taxis were a very powerful family , and time was not on our side . A letter from Monsieur Gustave . Zero . You want me to ? Read it . " My dear and trusted colleagues ... " I miss you deeply as I write from the confines of my regrettable and preposterous incarceration . Until I walk amongst you again as a free man , the Grand Budapest remains in your hands , as does its impeccable reputation . Keep it spotless and glorify it . Take extra special care of every little- bitty bit of it as if I were watching over you like a hawk with a horse whip in its talons , because I am . Should I discover a lapse of any variety during my absence , I promise , swift and merciless justice will descend upon you . A great and noble house has been placed under your protection . Tell Zero if you see any funny business . " Your devoted Monsieur Gustave . " Then there 's a poem , but we might want to start on the soup since it 's 46 stanzas . " A moist , black ash dampens the filth of a dung- dark rat 's nest " and mingles with the thick scent of wood rot " while the lark song of a guttersnipe ... " JOPLING : I never trusted that butler . He 's too honest . DMITRI ON PHONE : Too honest , you say ? JOPLING : Mmm- hmm . Right , well , be that as it may , find him quick and make it snappy . May I offer any of you inmates a plate of mush ? No ? Anyone ? You with the very large scar on your face ? Try it . It 's actually quite warm and nourishing this morning . It needs a dash of salt . Good day . Mush , gents ? Any takers ? Suit yourselves . Rise and shine . Chop , chop . Good morning , Pinky . Mendl 's again ? Precisely . Who 's got the throat slitter ? Out of this world . GUSTAVE H : Mendl 's is the best . Well , back to work . Monsieur Gustave ? Yes ? PINKY : Me and the boys talked it over . We think you 're a really straight fellow . Well , I' ve never been accused of that before , but I appreciate the sentiment . You 're one of us now . What a lovely thing to say . Thank you , dear Pinky . Thank you , Gunther . Thank you , Wolf . Anything else ? Tell him , Ludwig . Checkpoint 19 ain 't no two- bit hoosegow . You got broad- gauge iron bars on every door , vent and window . You got 72 guards on the floor and 16 more in the towers . You got a 325- foot drop into a moat full of crocodiles . But , like the best of them , it 's got a soft spot , which in this case happens to take the form of a storm- drain sewer system dating from the time of the original rock fortification way back in the Middle Ages . Now , nobody 's saying it 's a stroll down a tree- lined promenade with a fine lady and a white poodle , but it 's got what you 'd call " vulnerability , " and that 's our bread and butter . Take a look . Who drew this ? What do you mean , " Who drew this ? " I did . Very good . You 've got a wonderful line , Ludwig . This shows great artistic promise . Question , how do you intend to penetrate this lowest rudiment ? It 's 25 inches of reinforced granite masonry , is it not ? Digging with the throat- slitter , I expect this would take three to six months of continual effort , during which time several of our members will have been violently executed . You hit the nail on the head , Mr . Gustave . We got fake documents , second- hand street clothes , a rope ladder made of sticks and bunk- linens , but we need digging tools , which are proving hard to come by in this flop- house . YOUNG WRITER : At this point in the story , the old man fell silent and pushed away his saddle of lamb . His eyes went blank as two stones . I could see he was in distress . Are you ill , Mr . Moustafa ? I finally asked . Oh , dear me , no . He said . It 's only that I don 't know how to proceed . He was crying . You see , I never speak of Agatha , because even at the thought of her name I 'm unable to control my emotions . Well , I suppose there 's no way around it . You see , she saved us . On our third formal rendezvous , I had asked for her hand in marriage and she had agreed . Will you marry me ? Yes . We did not have 50 Klubecks between the two of us . No one knew , of course , but , then , who would have cared ? We were each completely on our own in the world , and we were deeply in love . Here . Thank you . It 's a book . I see . Romantic Poetry , Volume One . Monsieur Gustave recommended it . I have a copy of my own as well . I ruined the surprise , I suppose . I' ll go ahead and open it , anyway . Read the inscription . MR . MOUSTAFA : Monsieur Gustave insisted on an immediate and thorough cross- examination ... She 's charming . She 's so charming . During which he presented Agatha with a porcelain pendant and five dozen individually tissue- wrapped white tulips in a box the size of a child 's coffin . It 's not right . I beg your pardon ? Why is he sulking ? She 's my girlfriend . You can 't just buy her things . I 'm only interviewing this vision of loveliness on your behalf . Never be jealous in this life , Zero , not even for an instant . Is he flirting with you ? Yes . I approve of this union . Agatha , my beauty , return to your beloved . MR . MOUSTAFA : Soon we learned ... GUSTAVE H : Blessings upon you both . Not only was Agatha immensely skilled with a palette knife and a butter- cream flourish ... Mendl . Go . She was also very brave . I believe she was born that way . Something 's missing . A crucial document , either misplaced or , conceivably , destroyed . I don 't know what it contains , I don 't know what it represents , I don 't know what it is , but there are traces and shadows of it everywhere . Now , I don 't want to alarm you , and I don 't expect to see any significant change in the magistrate 's ultimate decision vis- à- vis your own inheritance , but , especially given the circumstances of the death , as well as the disappearance of the key witness in the murder case , Serge X , I suggest that we immediately bring this matter to the attention of the municipal inspector so that there can be absolutely no question of impropriety at any future date . Agreed ? Not agreed . Not agreed ? Not agreed . Can I ask you a question , Vilmos ? Yes , Dmitri ? Who are you working for ? I beg your pardon ? Who are you working for ? I thought you 're supposed to be our lawyer . Well , in point of fact , I 'm the executor of the estate . In this particular situation , I represent the deceased . Oh , yeah ? Yeah . A provision for my fees was included in the ... Just wrap it up and don 't make waves . Agreed ? I 'm an attorney . I 'm obligated to proceed according to the rule of law . Not agreed . This stinks , sisters . Did he just throw my cat out the window ? I don 't think so . No . Did he ? Jopling ? Shh- shh . LUDWIG : Okay . There 's something I haven 't told you , Agatha . Okay . We stole a painting . It 's very valuable , maybe five million Klubecks , in fact . I don 't know if anyone 's even noticed it 's missing yet , but if something should happen to me ... You steal art ? One picture . Anyway , we need to make a plan for your survival . Hide this . It 's in code and you might need a magnifying glass to read it , but it tells you exactly where and how to find Boy with Apple . Don 't take less than half the retail asking price . Also ... Zero , I 'm a baker . You 're a pastry chef . I 'm not a fence , if that 's the term . I don 't trade in stolen property . I said it wrong . She willed it to him . Go to sleep . Yes , Herr Mendl . Hide this . No . Okay , but take it anyway . MR . MOUSTAFA : The next morning , Herr Becker received a peculiar , last- minute notice from the office of Deputy Kovacs , postponing their scheduled meeting , in perpetuity . LUDWIG : Let 's blow . How did you get out there ? Shut the fuck up . These guys are trying to escape . What 's wrong with you , you goddamn snitch ? Guard ! Guard ! It 's you . Thank you . Thank you , you sweet , kind man . LUDWIG : Okay . ALL : Whoa ! I suppose you 'd call that a draw . Good evening . Let me introduce you . Pinky , Wolf , Ludwig , this is the divine Zero . Gunther was slain in the catacombs . Well , boys , who knows when we 'll all meet again , but if one clay ... Hold it . No time to gab . Take care of yourself , Mr . Gustave . Good luck , kid . Which way to the safe house ? I couldn 't find one . No safe house ? Really ? We 're completely on our own out here ? I 'm afraid so . I asked around , but ... GUSTAVE H : I understand . Too risky . We 'll just have to wing it , I suppose . Let 's put on our disguises . We 're wearing them . No , we 're not . We said false whiskers and fake noses and so on . You didn 't bring any ? I thought you were growing one . And it wouldn 't look realistic , would it ? No , when done properly , they 're perfectly convincing . But I take your point . So be it . Give me a few squirts of L' air de Panache , please , will you ? Can I not get a squirt , even ? I forgot the L' air de Panache . Honestly , you forgot the L' air de Panache ? I don 't believe it . How could you ? I' ve been in jail , Zero ! Do you understand how humiliating this is ? I smell . That 's just marvelous , isn 't it ? I suppose this is to be expected back in ... Where do you come from again ? Aq Salim al- Jabat . Precisely . I suppose this is to be expected back in Aq Salim al- Jabat where one 's prized possessions are a stack of filthy carpets and a starving goat , and one sleeps behind a tent flap and survives on wild dates and scarabs . But it 's not how I trained you . What on God 's earth possessed you to leave the homeland where you obviously belong and travel unspeakable distances to become a penniless immigrant in a refined , highly- cultivated society that , quite frankly , could 've gotten along very well without you ? The war . Say again ? Well , you see , my father was murdered and the rest of my family were executed by firing squad . Our village was burned to the ground and those who managed to survive were forced to flee . I left because of the war . I see . So you 're , actually , really more of a refugee , in that sense ? Truly . Well , I suppose I 'd better take back everything I just said . What a bloody idiot I am . Pathetic fool . Goddamn , selfish bastard . This is disgraceful , and it 's beneath the standards of the Grand Budapest . I apologize on behalf of the hotel . It 's not your fault . You were just upset I forgot the perfume . Don 't make excuses for me . I owe you my life . You are my dear friend and protégé and I 'm very proud of you . You must know that . I 'm so sorry , Zero . We 're brothers . How 's our darling Agatha ? " ' Twas first light when I saw her face upon the heath , " and hence did I return , day- by- day , entranced , " tho' vinegar did brine my heart , never ... " Very good . I 'm going to stop you there because the alarm has sounded , but remember where we left off because I insist you finish later . I want roadblocks at every junction for 50km . I want rail blocks at every train station for 100km . I want 50 men and 10 bloodhounds ready in five minutes . We 're going to strip- search every pretzel- Ha us , Waffel- hut , Biergarten and especially every grand hotel from Äugenzburg to Zilchbrück . These men are dangerous , professional criminals . At least three of them are anyway . Who are you ? What are you doing here ? Civilian personnel aren 't permitted in the cellblock . This is a military investigation . This is Mr . Jopling , sir . His employer 's mother was one of the victims ... Shut up . You work for the family Desgoffe und Taxis ? Are you aware of the murder of Deputy Vilmos Kovacs on 23rd October ? I 'm aware of his disappearance . His body was found stuffed in a sarcophagus behind a storage room at the Kunstmuseum late last night . He was short four fingers . What do you know about that ? Nothing . Escort Mr . Jopling off the premises . Mendl 's . Operator , get me the Excelsior Palace in Baden- Jurgen and reverse the charges , please . We 've no choice . There 's nowhere else to turn . I' ll hold . Thank you . It 's our only hope . Otherwise , I shouldn 't even mention its existence to you . It goes without saying , never breathe a word about this to a living soul . Do you swear ? Of course . What is it , in fact ? I can 't say . How does one come by front- row aisle seats for a first night at the Opera Toscana with one day 's notice ? How does one arrange a private viewing of the tapestry collection at the Royal Saxon Gallery ? How does one secure a corner table at Chez Dominique on a Thursday ? Ivan , darling , it 's Gustave . Hello . Well , I was until about five minutes ago . We 've taken it upon ourselves to clear out in a hurry if you see what I mean . Well , through a sewer , as it happens . Exactly . Listen , Ivan , I 'm sorry to out you off , but we 're in a bit of a bind . This is an official request . I 'm formally calling upon the special services of ... IVAN : I' ll call you back , Gustave . Right . Stand by . I beg your pardon . Do you prefer to walk ? We 're right here . It 's very simple . Straight down the corniche , then left . Jojo , see the gentleman out . Get me Monsieur Georges at the Château Luxe , please . Happy birthday to you Take over . Happy birthday , dear ... GEORGES : Hello , Ivan ? Got it . Get me Monsieur Dino at the Palazzo Principessa , please . Higher , goddammit , higher ! Take over . DINO : Monsieur Georges . Higher . I see . Straightaway . Get me Monsieur Robin at L'Hôtel Côte du Cap , please . And two and three . Monsieur Robin . There 's a call from Monsieur Dino for you . Take over . One , two , three . ROBIN : Yes , Dino . Yes , Dino . Okay , Dino . Get me Monsieur Martin at the Ritz Imperial , please . Too much salt . Not enough pepper - Take over . Robin ? Martin . Too much salt . So I' ve heard . Maybe . Let me make a few calls . Serge X , missing . Deputy Kovacs , also missing . Madame D , dead . Boy with Apple , stolen , by us . Dmitri and Jopling , ruthless , cold- blooded savages . Gustave H , at large . What else ? Zero , confused . Zero , confused , indeed . The plot " thickens , " as they say . Why , by the way ? Is it a soup metaphor ? I don 't know . Get in . IVAN : We found the butler . He 's hiding out in the remote foothills near Gabelmeister 's Peak . Our contact convinced him to meet you midday tomorrow at the observatory on the summit . Tell no one . He 'll explain everything . Your train departs in four and a half minutes . Here 's your tickets . Third class ? It was overbooked but the conductor used to be a sommelier at the old Versailles . He pulled some strings . You 'll need these for the dining car . One last thing . L' air de Panache . They only had the half- ounce . We should give him something as a symbolic gesture . How much money you got ? 42 Klubecks and 3 postage stamps . Give me 25 . Yes . Bless you . Please . JOPLING : I' ve got to hand it to him . DMITRI ON PHONE : Jesus Christ . JOPLING : I didn 't see that coming . Well , what do you want next ? DMITRI : Talk to the club- footed sister again , and , this time , be persuasive . DMITRI : Goddamn son of a bitch . Holy fuck ! What 's the meaning of this shit ? Boy with Apple ? I thought you 'd hidden it . Why are you only noticing now ? I assumed it went to the tax appraiser . Are you fucking kidding me ? CLOTILDE : Excusez- moi . I believe it was removed by Monsieur Gustave . I 'm not angry with Serge . You can 't blame someone for their basic lack of moral fiber . He 's a frightened , little , yellow- bellied coward . It 's not his fault , is it ? I don 't know . It depends . Well , you can say that about most anything . " It depends . " Of course it depends . Of course it depends . Of course it depends . Yes , I suppose you 're right . Of course it depends . That doesn 't mean I 'm not going to throttle the little swamp rat . May I officiate , by the way ? The ceremony ? With pleasure . I must say , I find that girl utterly delightful . Flat as a board , enormous birthmark the shape of Mexico over half her face , sweating for hours on end in that sweltering kitchen while Mendl , genius though he is , looms over her like a hulking gorilla . Yet without question , without fail , always and invariably , she 's exceedingly lovely . Why ? Because of her purity . She admires you as well , Monsieur Gustave . Does she ? Very much . That 's a good sign , you know . It means she " gets it . " That 's important . Don 't flirt with her . LIEUTENANT : A radio telegram was delivered and signed for by the girl at 4 : 00 AM . The envelope was found near the body , but its contents were missing . However , the telegraph office always keeps a carbon of the ticker tape for 24 hours . I copied it down . It reads as follows , " Pack your things stop . " Be ready to leave at moment 's notice stop . " Hide- out is vicinity of Gabelmeister 's Peak stop . " Destroy this message all my love full stop . " Where 's the basket ? PUMP ATTENDANT : Where you headed , mister ? Skiing ? Sledding ? Mountain climbing ? Three Klubecks . MR . MOUSTAFA : By express wireless , I wrote Agatha with instructions to move to our pre- arranged hideout , a Gypsy caravan on the outer Nebelsbad road , while Monsieur Gustave and I continued east into the Zubrowkian Alps , toward our high- altitude rendezvous with the butler Serge X . As a precaution , we disembarked quietly in the freight yard just outside the station . L' air de Panache . It 's a hell of a view . I give them that , for what 's it 's worth . I agree . " ' Tis oft ' - remarked , no single , falling- flake does any other " in its pure and perfect form ... " Somebody 's coming . Are you Monsieur Gustave of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad ? Uh- huh . Get on the next cable car . Are you Monsieur Gustave of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad ? Uh- huh . Switch with me . Are you Monsieur Gustave of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad ? Uh- huh . Put these on and sing . MONK : Psst . Are you Monsieur Gustave of the ... Yes , dammit . Confess . I 'm innocent . Hmm ? No , no . Forgive me , Monsieur Gustave . I never meant to betray you . They threatened my life and now they 've murdered my only family . No . Who did they kill this time ? My dear sister . The girl with the club foot ? Yes . Those fuckers ! I tried to warn you at the beginning . I know , darling . Let 's put that behind us . Listen , I hate to put you on the spot , but I really must ask you to clear my name . Obviously you 're grieving ... There 's more . To the story . I get it . Go on . I was the official witness in Madame D 's presence to the creation of a second will to be executed only in the event of her death by murder . A second will ? Right . In case she got bumped off ? Right . Uh- huh ? But they destroyed it . Oh , dear . However ... Uh- huh ? I pulled a copy . A second copy of the second will ? Right . Uh- huh ? What does it say ? Where is it ? What 's it all about , dammit ? Don 't keep us in suspense . This has been a complete fucking nightmare . Just tell us what the fuck is going on ! Serge ? Serge ? Serge ! Bloody hell . They 've strangled the poor slob . Come on ! Let 's go ! ZERO : What do we do if we catch him ? GUSTAVE H : I don 't know . He 's a homicidal psychopath . Let 's stop . I can 't . I can barely steer . You sick , pathetic creep . I hate you . " ' If this do be me end , farewell ! ' " cried the wounded piper- boy , " whilst the muskets cracked " and the yeomen roared ' Hurrah ! ' " And the ramparts fell . " ' Methinks me breathes me last , me fears ! ' said he ... " Holy shit ! You got him ! Well done , Zero ! Gustave H ! You are a fugitive from justice ! Surrender lawfully and I will personally vouchsafe your fair treatment . Do not attempt to flee ! ZERO : What do you think ? I don 't know . I 'd rather jump off this cliff right now than go back to fucking prison . I say we steal that sick maniac 's motorcycle , go fetch Agatha , take back Boy with Apple and head for the Maltese Riviera , once and for all . Very good ! You 're so extraordinary , Zero . Thank you . A moment of silence in memoriam of a devoted servant killed violently during the conduct of his duties . Goodbye , Serge . Okay , let 's go . MR . MOUSTAFA : The war began at midnight . Pffeifelstad fell by lunch under heavy shelling , and 10 battalions surged across the long western border . High- command advanced to Nebelsbad . Compliments of Herr Mendl , for the executive staff . CHUCK : General Stieglitz requests a garden- view sitting room with an extra roll- away . Let 's put him in the Duke Leopold Suite . Secretary Woroniecki 's office cabled . He 's checking in a day early . Rooms 401 - 2- 3 . Tell Tactical Logistics we 're moving them to a standard double on the third floor . They 'll need more space than that . GUSTAVE H : The beginning of the end of the end of the beginning has begun . A sad finale played off- key on a broken- down saloon piano in the outskirts of a forgotten ghost town . I 'd rather not bear witness to such blasphemy . Me neither . The Grand Budapest has become a troops' barracks . I shall never cross its threshold again in my lifetime . Me neither . Never again shall I ... Actually , I think we might be going in there right now after all . Dmitri . Agatha . Good evening , Mr . Desgoffe und Taxis . I 'm Monsieur Chuck . We 've booked you and your sisters into the King Ferdinand Suite . Good evening . General von Shrecker asked me ... Who 's that ? I beg your pardon ? I think that girl 's got my picture . Excuse me . AGATHA : Six . DMITRI : Hold it . DMITRI : Six . Compliments of Herr Mendl . GUSTAVE H : Excuse me . Have you seen a pastry girl with a package under her arm in the last minute and a half ? Yep . She just got on the elevator with Mr . Desgoffe und Taxis . Thank you . I 'm sorry . Who are you ? Otto , sir , the new Lobby Boy . You haven 't been trained properly . A Lobby Boy never provides information of that kind . You 're a stone wall . Understood ? Pretty picture . Sixth floor . Where 's Boy with Apple ? None of your goddamn business ! I 'm going to blast your candy- ass once and for all right now . Drop your weapon ! Cease fire ! Cease fire ! Whoa ! Stop it ! Who 's shooting who ? That 's Gustave H ! The escaped murderer and art thief . I' ve got him cornered ! That 's Dmitri Desgoffe und Taxis ! He 's responsible for the killing of Deputy Kovacs , Serge X and his club- footed sister , plus his own mother ! Nobody move . Everybody 's under arrest . Who 's out the window ? Agatha ! 310- bis . Hang on ! Here I come ! AGATHA : Something 's on the back of the ... Agatha ! Agatha ! Are you all right ? I think so . Something 's on the back of the picture . MR . MOUSTAFA : She left everything to Monsieur Gustave , of course . The mansion , known as Schloss Lutz , the factories , which produced weapons , medicine and textiles , an important newspaper syndicate , and perhaps you 've already deduced this very institution , the Grand Budapest Hotel . He anointed me his successor , and as the war continued , I served my adopted country from the narrow desk still found against the wall in the next room . He was the same as his disciples , insecure , vain , superficial , blond , needy . In the end he was even rich . He did not succeed , however , in growing old . " Dearly beloved , we are gathered together ... " MR . MOUSTAFA : Nor did my darling Agatha . She and our infant son would be killed two years later by the Prussian grippe . An absurd little disease . Today we treat it in a single week , but , in those days many millions died . On the 21st day of the occupation , the morning the independent state of Zubrowka officially ceased to exist , we traveled with Monsieur Gustave to Lutz . In answer to your earlier question , by the way , of course . Zero asked me about my humble beginnings in the hotel trade . I was , perhaps , for a time , considered the best Lobby Boy we 'd ever had at the Grand Budapest . I think I can say that . This one finally surpassed me . Although , I must say , he had an exceptional teacher . Truly . " Whence came these two radiant , celestial brothers , " united , for an instant , " as they crossed the stratosphere of our starry window ? " One from the East and one from the West . " Very good . Don 't flirt with her . Why are we stopping at a barley field again ? I find these black uniforms very drab . Well , hello there , chaps . We were just talking about you . Documents , please . With pleasure , as always . You 're the first of the official death squads to whom we 've been formally introduced . How do you do ? Plus ça change , am I right ? Uh , that 's a migratory visa with stage three worker status , darling . Read this . SOLDIER : Come outside . GUSTAVE H : Now , stay there . I give you my word , if you lay a finger on this man , I' ll see you dishonorably discharged , locked up in the stockade and hanged by sundown . MR . MOUSTAFA : There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity . You filthy , goddamn , pock- marked , fascist assholes ! MR . MOUSTAFA : He was one of them . What more is there to say ? What happened in the end ? In the end they shot him . So it all went to me . YOUNG WRITER : After dinner , we went to collect the keys to our rooms , but Monsieur Jean had abandoned his post . I expect he 's forgotten all about us . YOUNG WRITER : In recent years , of course , such properties and holdings as the Grand Budapest had with very few exceptions become common property . While the precise terms of his negotiation with the new government had never been announced , the result was an open secret , Zero Moustafa had traded a great and important fortune in exchange for one costly , unprofitable , doomed hotel . Why ? Was it merely sentimental ? It was quite forward of me and a bit out of character , but I felt I must know , for my health , I suppose . Forgive me for asking . I hope I haven 't upset you . No , of course not . Is it simply your last connection to that vanished world , his world , if you will ? His world ? No , I don 't think so . You see , we shared a vocation . It wouldn 't have been necessary . No . The hotel I keep for Agatha . We were happy here . For a little while . To be frank , I think his world had vanished long before he ever entered it . But , I will say , he certainly sustained the illusion with a marvelous grace . Are you going up ? No , I' ll sit for a little while . Good night . YOUNG WRITER : The next week , I sailed for a cure in South America and began a long , wandering journey abroad . I did not return to Europe for many years . It was an enchanting old ruin . AUTHOR : But I never managed to see it again . Where are you going ? I won 't be long . Welcome , Signor Soiarra . I trust you had a pleasant journey . Do you have it ? Yes . It 's over there . When do we blow the stadium ? This evening at six . And the flight out of here ? All arranged . And then what ? Then I visit The Pale King . A toast , my friend . To Death ! Bottoms up . Meet me in the square ! Start anywhere you like . Take your time , 007 , but in five minutes the head of the Joint Security Service is going to walk through that door , and I' ve got to explain to him how one of our agents decided to potter off to Mexico , all on his own , and cause an international incident . With all due respect , sir , it could 've been worse . Worse ? You blew up half a bloody block . Well , better half a block than a whole stadium full of people . You had no authority . None . As you know , we 're in the middle of the biggest shakeup in the history of British intelligence . The ink 's barely dry on this merger with MI5 and already they 're itching for a chance to scrap the double- 0 program forever . And you 've just given them one . You 're right , sir . You have got a tricky day ahead . This is an official question . Mexico City . What were you doing there ? It was just a coincidence . I was taking some overdue holiday . Okay . Fine . As of this morning , you are officially grounded . I 'm standing you down from all operations indefinitely . Very good , sir . 007 ? Sir ? I don 't know what you 're playing at , but whatever it is , it has to stop . Now . - So sorry . Am I interrupting ? - Not remotely . 007 , I 'd like you to meet Max Denbigh , head of the Joint Security Service . It 's a pleasure to finally meet you , 007 . I' ve heard a lot about you . Most of it good . - Congratulations on your new appointment . - Thank you . - I suppose we should call you C now . - No , no . " Max , " please . No , I think I' ll call you C ... C . As you wish . Well , my door is always open , 007 , for my employees . This merger 's gonna be a whole new chapter for us . We 're going to bring British intelligence out of the Dark Ages ... into the light . That all sounds lovely . That 'll be all , 007 . Report to Q tomorrow for medical , thank you . Very good , sir . - James ? - Moneypenny . - So ? How was the meeting ? - Very good , thank you . - Here . Forensics finally released this . - What is it ? It 's personal effects they recovered from Skyfall . - Perfect . You can bring it to me later . - What do you mean ? My place , 9 : 00 . - Evening . - Come in . - Have you just moved in ? - No . Well , I like what you 've done with the place . Your delivery . Thank you . - Would you like a drink ? - No , thanks . I 'm not staying . That 's a shame . What 's going on , James ? There 's not one person at MI6 who isn 't talking about it . Talking about what , exactly ? That what you did in Mexico was one step too far . - That you 're finished . - And what do you think ? I think you 're just getting started . I don 't know what you mean . All right . I think you 've got a secret . And it 's something you won 't tell anyone . Because you don 't trust anyone . If anything happens to me , 007 , I need you to do something . Find a man called Marco Sciarra . Kill him . And don 't miss the funeral . Jesus . - Where did you get it ? - In my mailbox just after she died . Well , she was never short of surprises . She wasn 't gonna let death get in the way of her job . I' ve been tracking Sciarra ever since . - And what have you found ? - Nothing significant yet . When 's the funeral ? Three days . In Rome . If you think M 's signing off on that , you 're insane . - He won 't let you out of his sight . - Yes , it 's a bit of a problem . Listen ... could you do a little quiet digging for me ? I heard a name in Mexico . " The Pale King . " You want me to be your mole . Yes . And what makes you think you can trust me ? Instinct . Poor old girl . Rigged for demolition in a week . Cheaper to knock her down than to rebuild . Still . Time waits for no man and all that . Anyway , all the money 's been spent on this ... the New Centre for National Security . So that 's C´s new digs . You 've met him , have you ? - Yesterday . What do we know about him ? - Classic Whitehall mandarin . Wrote a dossier last year on how the double- 0 program was obsolete , how drones could do all our dirty work abroad . - Went to school with the Home Secretary . - Of course , he did . This merger 's just the start of it . In three days , there 's a security conference in Tokyo to decide the New World Order . If C gets his way , he 'll have unlimited access to the combined the intelligence streams of nine countries . Including us . Quite . Well , a lot 's happened while you were away . A train bombing in Hamburg and an industrial explosion in Tunisia . It 's not great timing for us . It 's all rather playing into C 's hands . M , well , let 's say he 's feeling the pressure . Yeah , I' ve noticed . Now , this way , 007 . Be careful . It 's a trifle slippery . Q wasn 't exactly feeling at home in Whitehall , what with the new merger , so he set up shop here , away from prying eyes , as it were . I hear he 's got something rather special planned for you . I can hardly wait . 007 . - Q . - Please excuse the mess . Everything 's a little bit up in the air , what with the changes and all . Couple of things to get through . Shall we get started ? Just relax . That 's it . Lovely . Now , you may feel a small ... - Christ ! - ... prick . - What is it ? - Cutting- edge nanotechnology . Smart Blood . Microchips in your bloodstream . Allows us to track your movements in the field . You see those readouts ? We can monitor your vital signs from anywhere on the planet . Well , that sounds marvelous . Call it a post- Mexico insurance policy . By direct order of M . I completely understand . Good . Right . Well , I' ve just ... got one last thing for you and you can be on your way . Magnificent , isn 't she ? Zero to 60 in three point two seconds . Fully bulletproof . A few little tricks up her sleeve . It 's a shame , really . She was meant for you , but she 's been reassigned to 009 . But you can have this . - Does it do anything ? - It tells the time . - Might help with your punctuality issues . - M 's idea ? Precisely . Oh , one word of warning . The alarm is rather loud . - If you know what I mean . - I think I do . Oh , yes . That old thing is taking quite a bit of time . Mind you , there wasn 't much left to work on . Only a steering wheel . I believe I said , " Bring it back in one piece , " not , " Bring back one piece . " Anyway , enjoy your downtime , 007 . - Q ? - Yes ? Well , now you know exactly where I am all of the time . - Will you do something for me ? - What do you have in mind , exactly ? Make me disappear . May I remind you that I answer directly to M . I also have a mortgage . And two cats to feed . Well , then I suggest you trust me ... for the sake of the cats . Well , it 's lovely to see you , 007 . Lovely . Now , I meant to tell you , the Smart Blood program is obviously still in its developmental phase . So we may experience the odd drop in coverage during the first 24 hours ... 48 hours after administration , but after that it should work perfectly . - I' ll send you a postcard . - Please , don 't . - Morning . What 's that ? - Oh , it 's just something from an admirer . - It 's not your birthday , is it ? - No , sir . That was last week . Morning . 009 has arrived to pick up the DB10 , sir . He 's waiting upstairs . Oh , good . Yes , fine . Oh , shit . I 'm sorry for your loss . - You knew my husband ? - All too briefly . - What do you do ? - Life insurance . A little late for that . For your husband , yes . But what about you ? Me ? I hear the life expectancy of some widows can be very short . How can you talk like this ? Can 't you see I 'm grieving ? No . What a lovely view . You 're wasting your time . There are 100 more that will come after me . All you buy me is five minutes . Excellent . Time for a drink . You killed him ... didn 't you ? My husband . He was an assassin . Trust me , he won 't take it personally . You signed my death warrant . I was respected . - Loyal to a man you hated . - He trusted my silence . With him gone , I 'm a dead woman . - I can trust nobody . - I know the feeling well . Well , I can tell you that I don 't trust you . Well , then you have impeccable instincts . If you don 't leave now , we 'll die together . I can think of worse ways to go . Then you 're obviously crazy , Mister ... Bond . James Bond . These people ... if you just knew what they could do . The power they have . Did your husband ever mention " The Pale King ? " No . The organization ... they hardly ever meet . But because of what happened to my husband , - they meet tonight . - Why ? To choose a replacement . Where ? The Palazzo Cardenza . - Midnight . - Sounds like fun . I might drop by . He was obsessed . He spent more time with them than with me . Then the man was a fool . Leaving your number ? I' ve called an American friend of mine . Felix . He 'll contact his embassy and get you out of here . You 'll be safe . Don 't go , James . If you go there , you 're crossing over to a place where there is no mercy . I have to go . Bona fortuna , Dona Lucia . Identify yourself , asshole . Who are you ? I 'm Mickey Mouse . Who are you ? Pharmacy sites has provided an excellent new sales platform . We have adapted many of them into clearinghouses for unapproved drugs . In addition to which , the latest figures show that we presently control 70 % of antimalarial vaccines , 34 % of H . I . V . , and 40 % of all oncological drugs across Sub- Saharan Africa . But we face challenges from the WHO in their campaign against our counterfeit pharmaceuticals . We have now identified the key individuals to target . We expect the same success as we had against the Council on Human Trafficking . Since the board 's resignation ... we have placed 160, 000 migrated females into the leisure sector . The impending completion of the Global Surveillance initiative ... will mean our capability is second to none ... and now is the moment for aggressive expansion . The news is only good ... Don 't let me interrupt you . The news is only good ... Our increased surveillance capability ... means government intelligence agencies ... are easily counteracted . We are winning . Thank you , Doctor . Now , on to the matter at hand . After the success of our attacks in Hamburg and Tunisia , the aborted attack in Mexico City and the death of our valued colleague , Marco Sciarra , leaves one of his duties outstanding . Signor Guerra , The Pale King must be terminated . Will you make the journey to Altaussee ? Of course . My loyalty to this organization is total . I will protect it with my last breath . There will be no more ... amateurs . No more shows of weakness . Does anyone challenge Signor Guerra for this position ? Welcome . State your credentials for succeeding Signor Sciarra . It 's funny . All that excitement in Mexico City rang a distant bell . And now ... suddenly , this evening , it makes perfect sense . Welcome , James . It 's been a long time . But , finally , here we are . What took you so long ? Cuckoo . Ciao , Mickey Mouse . Oh , you 've got to be kidding me . No . Moneypenny . - Bond ? - Listen , Moneypenny . Hamburg , Tunisia , Mexico City , they 're all linked . It 's one organization coordinating multiple attacks . - So , she was right . - Of course , she was . - I ran that check . - Who is it ? Oh , my boss had his credit card stolen . It 's nothing . - Why don 't you go back to sleep . - Don 't be long . - Who was that ? - No one . - No , it wasn 't . - It 's just a friend . At this time of night ? It 's called life , James . You should try it sometime . The Pale King . It looks like you 've had dealings with him before . Quantum . - Of course . Mr . White ! - That 's him . Last unconfirmed sighting , Altaussee in Austria , four months ago . Hold that thought . - You still there ? - Yeah . - Run another name , will you ? - Okay . Go . A man called Franz Oberhauser . He 's ... And check his files before and after his death . After his death ? What are you talking about ? Please , just do it . Okay , Q , give me something . That 's more like it . Here goes nothing . Good evening . Do not let them tell you we need less surveillance . We need more . Much more . I say again , the Nine Eyes committee would have full access to the combined intelligence streams of all member states . More data , more analysis , less likelihood of a terrorist attack . Ladies and gentlemen , it 's time for the security services of the world to unite . Alone , we are weak . Together , we 're a global power . An unelected one . Thank you . Thank you . We will now vote on the resolution . Ladies and gentlemen , please cast your vote . The vote is eight to one in favor . However , as you know , we cannot proceed unless by unanimous vote . The Nine Eyes motion is therefore not passed . Democracy . Thank you , ladies and gentlemen . This evening 's session is adjourned . - Yes , sir . - Please , tell me 007 is in London . Oh , yes . I' ll just take a look now , sir . Because if he isn 't , you 're in deep shit . You 've got precisely 10 seconds . I have him , sir . He appears to be in Chelsea . Well , I want eyes on him when I get back , understood ? I completely understand ... sir . Do me a favor . Make it quick . Upstairs , Mr . White . I always knew death would wear a familiar face , but not yours . To what do I owe this pleasure , Mr . Bond ? I was at a meeting recently and your name came up . I 'm flattered London is still talking about me . It wasn 't MI6 . It was Rome . Your team , not mine . Last month , I found thallium in my cell phone . It 's done its job . I have a few weeks . Maybe less . So , here we are , Mr . Bond , two dead men enjoying the evening . - What did you do ? - I disobeyed him . I followed him as far as I could . He ... - changed . - Oh , I see . You grew a conscience . Our game is our game . But this ? Women , children ... Well , the thallium would suggest that he doesn 't like you very much anymore . And clearly the feeling is mutual . So why don 't you tell me how to find him again ? Oh , come on . - Tell me where he is . - He 's everywhere . Everywhere ! He 's sitting at your desk , he 's kissing your lover , he 's eating supper with your family ! You 're protecting someone . Your wife . She left long ago . Your son ? Your daughter . You won 't find her . She 's clever . She 's smarter than me . She knows how to hide . I can protect her if you tell me where he is . - I can keep her alive . - Yeah . - You have my word . - Your word ? The word of an assassin ! That 's my word . L' Americain . You save her , she can lead you to L' Americain . She knows L' Americain . Try the Hoffler Klinik . You 're a kite dancing in a hurricane , Mr . Bond . So long . I can 't deny I 'm impressed you got H . M . G . to cough up for all this . Good God , the government couldn 't afford this kind of facility . No , it was benefactors mostly , from the private sector . When it goes online , this building will be the most sophisticated data gathering system in history . The world 's digital ghost , available 24/ 7 . - George Orwell 's worst nightmare . - I 'm glad you like it . My commiserations on losing the Nine Eyes vote . Must 've been a blow . Not really . Only a matter of time before the South Africans see the light . And you know what they say , Rome wasn 't built in a day . Day and a half maybe . Look , Max , I know surveillance is a fact of life . It 's how you use the information that concerns me , and who is using it . This is what we need to do to keep the people safe . Double- 0 program is prehistoric . Come on , M . You can 't really tell me that one man in the field can compete with all of this , running around out there with his license to kill . Have you ever had to kill a man , Max ? Have you ? To pull that trigger , you have to be sure . Yes , you investigate , analyze , assess , target . And then you have to look him in the eye . And you make the call . And all the drones , bugs , cameras , transcripts , all the surveillance in the world can 't tell you what to do next . A license to kill ... is also a license not to kill . I didn 't want to have to do this , but it looks like you still can 't control your agents . Bond ? I ran that check . Looks like you 've had dealings with him before . Quantum . Of course . Mr . White ! Last unconfirmed sighting , Altaussee in Austria . Run another name , will you ? So maybe there 's something to be said for total surveillance after all . You watch MI6 agents ? We watch everyone . Please , take a seat . I' ll be with you in just a moment . Please excuse me , Mr . Bond . My name is Dr . Madeleine Swann . Our job today is to analyze your needs , both psychological and physical . Sounds pretty straightforward . I hope you don 't mind . The view can be distracting . I hadn 't noticed . I see you filled out most of the paperwork . Just a few questions to complete your evaluation , if I may . - Do you exercise ? - When I have to . Do you consider your employment to be psychologically stressful ? - Sometimes . - How much alcohol do you consume ? Too much . Some broader questions . As a child , would you say you were close to your parents ? My parents died when I was young . Really ? How old ? - Old enough to remember . - How , if I may ask ? It was a climbing accident . - So who brought you up ? - Someone else . Humor me . How does one train at Oxford and the Sorbonne become a consultant , spend two years with Medecins Sans Frontieres ... and end up here ? Forgive me , but ... anyone might think you were hiding from something . You 're paying a lot of money to be here , Mr . Bond . - Who 's asking the questions , you or me ? - Of course . Carry on . I see you left this final question blank . What is your occupation ? Well , that 's not the sort of thing that looks good on a form . - And why is that ? - I kill people . Small world ? - Where is he ? - Your father 's dead . - Two days ago . - How do you know ? - Because I was there . - Did you kill him ? I didn 't have to . He did it himself . And you came all the way just to tell me this ? That my father 's dead ? I came to tell you that your life is in danger and I need your help . - Why ? - I made a deal with him to protect you . You 're lying . Why would he trust you ? Because he knew that I needed something in return . And what was that ? To find L' Americain . - This interview is over . - Dr . Swann ... You have 10 minutes to leave the building . Then I 'm calling security . Thank you , Dr . Swann . - Can I get you something , sir ? - Vodka martini . Shaken , not stirred . I 'm sorry , we don 't serve alcohol . I 'm really starting to love this place . He 'll have the prolytic digestive enzyme shake . Certainly . If you 've come for the car , I parked it at the bottom of the Tiber . Well , not to worry , 007 . It was only a ¡ ê3, 000, 000 prototype . - Why are you here , Q ? - I just fancied a break , to be honest . I' ve been a tad stressed at work recently . What with C 's people crawling all over us and the fact that M wants my balls - for Christmas decorations . - Get to the point . The point , 007 , is that Franz Oberhauser is dead . Dead and buried . And unless you come back with me right now , my career and Moneypenny 's will go the same way . Do you understand ? All hell is breaking loose out there and ... - I saw him . - You thought you saw him . We 've been through the records . He died in an avalanche with his father 20 years ago . Yes . I know that . But I saw him . He 's not someone I' ll ever forget . - So you have a lead ? - I have a name . L' Americain . Well , that narrows it down . Look , I 'm sorry , 007 , but time 's up . My whole career is on the line here . Either you come back in and do this through proper channels , or I go directly to M . Do one more thing for me . Then you 're out . Find out what you can from this . - I really , really hate you right now . - Thank you , Q . Monsieur ? Now ? Please ? - Where are you staying ? - The Pevsner . Room 12 . One hour . Here you are , sir . One prolytic digestive enzyme shake . Do me a favor , will you ? Throw that down the toilet . Cut out the middleman . No ! Stay . What do you want ? What are you doing ? Can 't any of you speak ? Come on ! Right , come on . Come on . Don 't touch me ! Hey ! You need to take a breath and calm down . You 're in shock . Get away from me ! Just get away ! Did it cross your mind that you led them to me ? I haven 't got time for this . You need to tell me everything you know about L' Americain . Go to hell ! I gave your father my word ! And why should I trust you ? Because my father did ? Because right now , Dr . Swann ... I 'm your best chance of staying alive . Dr . Swann , Q . Q , Dr . Swann . - Hello . - Enchanted . Bond , we need to talk . Alone . - She knows . - But , Bond ... She knows . What have you got ? I owe you an apology , 007 . You are onto something . Oberhauser is still alive . The ring proves it . And it seems they were all part of one organization . Le Chiffre , Quantum , Sciarra , your friend Mr . Silva . And do you know who links them all ? - Him . - Exactly . This organization , do you know what it 's called ? - No . - Spectre . Its name is Spectre . - How does she know that ? - Because my father was part of it . Then I think that you ought to see this . You 're looking at pictures from South Africa right now - of what appears to be a huge explosion . - Q , go back to London . M 's gonna need your help . And keep tracking me . I will . And , Bond , you have to find L' Americain . He 's our only link to Oberhauser . It 's not a person . It 's a place . Thank you . This is where they spent their wedding night . They came back every year . Then they brought me with them , too . He kept coming back , even after the divorce . Well , then I 'm sorry . What for ? What is it ? It 's your inheritance . - Want some ? - No , thank you . You don 't know what you 're missing . This can 't be it . Well , here 's to your father . I promised myself I would never be hurt by that man again . I cut off all contact . I didn 't want anything to do with him or his sick life . And then , with his dying breath ... he sends me you . - Ironic , no ? - You shouldn 't be so hard on him . The man I just met should have been dead weeks ago . The only reason his heart was still beating was you . I' ll mourn my father in my own time , Mr . Bond . And , now , I 'm going to bed . Don 't think for one moment this is where I fall into your arms , seeking solace for my dead daddy . You sit there . Keep watch . That 's what you 're good at . Come anywhere near me and I' ll kill you . I don 't doubt it . Look . There are two of you . Two Jameses . Lucky me . What am I doing here ? To liars ... and killers . To liars ... and killers ... everywhere . Who sent you ? Who are you working for ? Now , where did you go ? Of course . What is it ? Nothing . - What 's this ? - It 's coordinates . Your father was scanning for a particular satellite phone . He was looking for someone . He was looking for him . And he sent me here to finish the job . - I 'm coming with you . - No , you 're not . - I like you alive . - I can look after myself . That 's beside the point . I might not be coming back . I know . But I want to understand what happened to my father . So , where was he going ? Nowhere . Thank you so much . Thanks . All the very best . What 's going on ? The meeting was brought forward . Did you not get the message ? - No , we didn 't . - Shortest meeting I can remember . - South Africans on board , I take it ? - Yeah , well , who can blame them ? Nine Eyes is now officially sanctioned . The new system goes live in less than 72 hours . It 's a major step forward . Global intelligence cooperation changes everything . As you said before . Look . They 've asked me to head the new committee . Yes ? And ? And I should tell you I' ve spoken with the Home Secretary . And in light of the new information I' ve given him , he 's decided to close down the double- 0 program with immediate effect . - You don 't know what you 're doing . - It 's not personal . It 's the future . And ... - You 're not . - You 're a cocky little bastard , aren 't you ? - I' ll take that as a compliment . - I wouldn 't . This isn 't over yet . - Would you press this for me ? Thank you . - Yes , sir . Pick it up . I hate guns . I promised him I 'd protect you . The first thing to do is to teach you how to protect yourself . What if I shoot you by mistake ? Wouldn 't be the first time . - Pick it up . - I said , I hate guns . SIG 226 . Front sight . Rear sight . Hammer . You just point it . You squeeze the trigger . You try not to close your eyes . Please ... try it . I don 't have to teach you anything , do I ? A man once came to our house to kill my father . He didn 't know I was upstairs playing in my bedroom . Or that Papa kept a Beretta Nine- millimeter under the sink with the bleach . That 's why I hate guns . I think we 'll skip hand- to- hand combat . Good evening , sir . Sorry to interrupt your supper , but we have some news . Evening , sir . Using the Smart Blood , I' ve tracked Bond to a point here in North Africa . See , every known map registers it as empty desert . Exactly . But if you look at the satellite blowup , you can clearly see this . We can 't help him . But , sir , we know where he 's heading . C is watching everything we do . We 're only handing them more information . Sir , we can 't just desert Bond . - We have to . We only make him weaker . - But , sir , we know exactly where he is . Yes , I know , but if we can track him , so can others . Delete all the Smart Blood files . Everything . He 's on his own . - You shouldn 't stare . - Well , you shouldn 't look like that . May I get you an aperitif ? I 'm not sure . It gets me into trouble . Makes me do crazy things . Well , we can 't have that . So , I' ll have a vodka martini , dirty . Make that two . - I have a question . - Well , what 's that ? Why , given every other possible option , does a man choose the life of a paid assassin ? Well , it was that or the priesthood . I 'm serious . Is this really what you want ? Living in the shadows ? Hunting ? Being hunted ? Always looking behind you ? Always alone ? But I 'm not alone . Answer the question . I 'm not sure I ever had a choice . Anyway , I don 't stop to think about it . What would happen if you did ? - Stop ? - Yes . I don 't know . - Your drinks , sir . - Could you leave them there , please ? You know , I think you 're wrong . I am ? We always have a choice . I' ll drink to that . Shit . What do we do now ? This might be a long wait . Are you having second thoughts ? Too late now . What 's that ? That is a 1948 Rolls- Royce Silver Wraith . Please . I 'm scared , James . Good afternoon , Mr . Bond , Dr . Swann . I want you to know just how excited we all are to finally meet you . Well ... it 's a pleasure to be here . Your host invites you both to rest , relax , and join him for drinks at 4 : 00 . - Tell our host we won 't be late . - Wonderful . Before we show you to your rooms , just one more thing . You be careful with that . It 's loaded . Thank you . This is a very special place . He has requested you enter it alone . Of course . Champagne ? Maybe later . Certainly . I think we 're meant to be impressed . Touch it . You can touch it if you want . - Do you know what it is ? - It 's a meteorite . Yes , exactly . The Kartenhoff . The oldest in human possession . The very meteorite which made this crater . Think about it . So many years up there , alone , silent , building momentum until it chose to make its mark on Earth . A huge , unstoppable force . Except it did stop , didn 't it ? Right here . I can 't tell you how much I' ve been looking forward to this . All of us here , together . A reunion . I 'm so glad you came , too , dear Madeleine . You were just a girl when I saw you first . I came to your home once to see your father . I don 't remember that . But I do . Shall we ? - What is this place ? - Information . Information is all ... is it not ? For example , you must know by now that the double- 0 program is officially dead . Which leads me to speculate exactly why you came . So , James , why did you come ? I came here to kill you . And I thought you came here to die . Well , it 's all a matter of perspective . Speaking of perspective . - Is this live ? - Live and direct . 16 : 20 GMT . What an uncanny coincidence . The French have a saying , " It 's the fate of glass to break . " Well , maybe it 's the fate of spies to just disappear . But with any luck , we leave something behind . In the meantime , I 'm sure C will keep you all busy . Thank you all . That 's touching , don 't you think ? Well , James ... it looks like you 're all alone . Not much more than a voyeur , are you ? Too scared to join in . - I don 't think you quite understand . - Oh , I think I do . You set cities on fire and watch innocent people burn , so you can convince governments to join an intelligence network you 've paid for . Not that complicated . I 'm guessing our little friend , C , he 's one of your disciples . - You could say that . - And what does he get out of it ? Nothing . He 's a visionary , like me . Visionaries . Psychiatric wards are full of them . Whereas you couldn 't see what 's right in front of you . You came across me so many times and yet you never saw me . Le Chiffre , Greene , Silva . - All dead . - Yeah , that 's right . A nice pattern developed . You interfered in my world , I destroyed yours . Or did you think it was coincidence that all the women in your life ended up dead ? Vesper Lynd , for example . She was the big one . Has he told you about her ? And then , of course , your beloved M . Gone forever . Me . It was all me , James . It 's always been me . The author of all your pain . You 're a brave woman , my dear . Now I understand why my father lost his mind . He didn 't lose his mind , he was just weak . But at least he understood what he was up against . You see , they failed to comprehend the crucial fact , that a terrible event can lead to something wonderful . Since you mention your father , I' ll show you . She 's clever . She 's smarter than me . She knows how to hide . I can protect her if you tell me where he is . - I can keep her alive . - Yeah . - You have my word . - No , no , no . Turn this off . Your word ? - The word of an assassin ! - Turn this off . - This is important . - I said turn it off ! I want you to understand something . That 's my word . Madeleine ? Look at me . Don 't look at him , Madeleine . Look at me . L' Americain . You save her , she can lead you to L' Americain . She knows L' Americain . Try the Hoffler Klinik . You 're a kite dancing in a hurricane , Mr . Bond . So long . The things that bring people together . Out of horror , beauty . Torture is easy , on a superficial level . A man can watch himself being disemboweled and ... derive great horror from the experience , but it 's still going on at a distance . It isn 't taking place where he is . As you know all too well , dear Madeleine , a man lives inside his head . That 's where the seat of his soul is . Now , James and I were both present recently when a man was deprived of his eyes . And the most astonishing thing happened . Didn 't you notice ? He wasn 't there anymore . He 'd gone even though he was still alive . So in this brief moment between life and death , there was nobody inside his skull . Most odd . So , James . I 'm going to penetrate ... to where you are . To the inside of your head . Now , the first probe will play with your sight , your hearing and your balance , just with the subtlest of manipulations . Well , get on with it then . Nothing can be as painful as listening to you talk . All right . Let 's begin . Why are you doing this ? You probably know that James here lost his parents when he was young . But did you know that it was my father who helped him through this difficult time ? Over the course of two winters he taught him to ski , and climb , and hunt . He soothed the wounds of the poor little blue- eyed orphan . Asked me to treat him as a brother . My little brother . They formed quite an attachment . So ... you killed him . Yes , I did . You know what happens when a cuckoo hatches inside another bird 's nest ? Yes . It forces the other eggs out . Yes . Well ... this cuckoo made me realize my father 's life had to end . In a way , he 's responsible for the path I took . So , thank you . Cuckoo . Do you know any other birdcalls , Franz ? Hello , pussy . Franz Oberhauser died 20 years ago , James . In an avalanche , alongside his father . The man you are talking to now , the man inside your head , is Ernst Stavro Blofeld . Catchy name . My mother 's bloodline . If the needle finds the correct spot in the fusiform gyrus , you 'll recognize no one . Of course , the faces of your women are interchangeable , aren 't they , James ? You won 't know who she is . Just another passing face on your way to the grave . He dies not knowing who you are . The daughter of an assassin . The only one who could have understood him . Shame . I love you . Do those blue eyes still recognize you ? I 'd recognize you anywhere . The watch . One minute . One minute . - Did he say something ? - Tempus fugit . - What ? - Tempus fugit . I can 't hear you , James . I said ... doesn 't time fly ? In there ! Let 's go home . It 's not over yet . - I' ve never even heard of Hildebrand . - That is the general idea with safe houses . - Exactly how safe is this , sir ? - We 're about to find out . It 's safe . Better wait here . - I 'm M . - Madeleine Swann . Pleased to meet you . So , what do you have for me , 007 ? The recently deceased head of Spectre , Ernst Stavro Blofeld , and his chief of intelligence , your new best friend , C . About to take control of his very own global surveillance system that he built right here under our noses . Then we 'd better move . The system goes online at midnight . If that happens , Spectre will have control of everything . So , you and I will have a quiet word with C while Q hacks into the system - and stops it going online . - It won 't be easy . He 'll find a way . He always does . It 's good to have you back , 007 . Sir . James , I can 't . I' ll come back for you when it 's all over . No , I can 't . No , you can 't stay here , or you ... I can 't go back to this life . And I 'm not going to ask you to change . This is who you are . You 're saying good- bye . Yes . Take care . You 're a good man , James . Are you in yet , Q ? A few layers of impenetrable security still to go , but I think I 'm getting somewhere . They 've seen us ! Reverse ! Go ! Get him in the building ! Move . Move ! Go back and find M , now ! We need them both . Not a good feeling being watched , is it ? - Don 't tell me you 're responsible for this . - No , but my Quartermaster is . - And he 's extremely talented . - Well , bravo . But in case you hadn 't realized it , you two are out of a job . So you 're trespassing . I 'm afraid you 've got the wrong end of the stick , Max . We 're going to stop this system going online . - And then I 'm going to bring you in . - On what grounds exactly ? Poor taste in friends . Take a look at the world . Chaos . Because people like you , paper- pushers and politicians , are too spineless to do what needs to be done . So I made an alliance to put the power where it should be . And now you want to throw it away for the sake of " democracy . " Whatever the hell that is . How predictably moronic . But then isn 't that what M stands for ? " Moron . " And now we know what C stands for . " Careless . " Come on . No , no , no ! You 're a hard man to kill , Blofeld . I do hope that doesn 't hurt too much . My wounds will heal . What about yours ? Look around you , James . Look . This is what 's left of your world . Everything you ever stood for , everything you believed in , a ruin . Why are we here ? Did you miss me ? No . But I know someone who does . Where is she ? That 's for you to find out . In three minutes , this building will be demolished . I can get out easily . Now , you have a choice . Die trying to save her or ... save yourself and live with the pain . You 're bluffing . Am I ? I' ve really put you through it , haven 't I ? That 's brothers for you . They always know which buttons to press . Madeleine ! Come on . Come on . Yes ! Let 's go . After you . Why can 't you just face it , M ? You don 't matter anymore . Maybe I don 't . But something has to . - Dead . - Any word on Bond ? No . But I can hazard a guess . Madeleine ! Madeleine ! - Do you trust me ? - Do I have a choice ? Not anymore . Come on ! Good- bye , James Bond . Brace , brace , brace ! - Sir , this is a terrorist alert . - Mallory , double- 0 section . Stand them down . - Echo team , hold fire . - Stand down . Finish it . Finish it . Out of bullets . And besides ... I' ve got something better to do . Under the Special Measures Act of 2001 , I am detaining you on behalf of Her Majesty 's Government . Bond ? - What are you doing here ? - Good morning , Q . - I thought you 'd gone . - I have . There 's just one thing I need . One forty- nine , please . - How much is the milk ? - Forty- nine pence . - Thank you very much . - Thank you . One pound , please . Thank you . Uh- uh . Too much . Much too much butter . I like butter . Denis . Mmm . - Milk 's gone up . - Hm ? - 49p a pint . - Good grief ! We 'll have to economize . I suppose we could always sell the car . Or take in paying guests . Watch out . She 's on the prowl . Eat your 699 . - Goodness ! There you are . - Yes . Here we are . How did this happen ? How could she possibly have got out ? It 's very , very important that the front door is left locked . - Of course . - Please , make it clear - to whoever 's on after you . - Dixon . I 'm afraid I 'm going to have to phone the station about this . - Anything could have happened . - I understand . Maria , she 's starting to clear her husband 's cupboard , so ... - Mm- hm . - I may need your help . Can you bring up any cases that you can find in the basement ? Of course . Mm ! Beautiful day . - Mm ... - Oh , you 've made a start . Carol 's coming soon , I' ll get some bags . Anything you want to go to Mark , I' ll bring up a suitcase for it . Uh- uh . No , no , no , no . The grey . - You sure ? - Mm ... Definitely the grey . Righty oh . Boss knows best . Don 't let her take my paper away . Oh , I haven 't had a chance to look at that yet , dear . Sorry . Atta girl . Ah ! Damn ! - Damn it . - Blot it . - Blot it . - Pardon ? You 're supposed to be looking after her . Now look what you 've done . Are they to keep the loonies out or you in ? Hm ... I' ll be off then . Wear your scarf . There is a chill out there . Good morning , Lady Thatcher . Are you all right ? - How are you feeling ? - I 'm fine , thank you , Susie . I' ve just been reading about the bombings . - Of course . Frightful . - Sorry - . These are the books for you to sign . I brought as many as I could find . Shall we go through your appointments ? We said we 'd go through them today . Yes . Of course , dear . Today . The invitation has come from Downing Street for the unveiling of your portrait . I' ll put that on the mantelpiece , and there 's an invitation from Lord Armstrong for lunch on the first Friday of next month . I said no , because you have a concert that afternoon , but if you 'd like to ... It looks like a very interesting program . What are they playing ? Um , I think they said ... ... Rodgers & Hammerstein . Oh . Oh ... Silly man . Oh , he hasn 't got his scarf on . - Did someone cover the butter ? - I' ll go . - Leave it ! - Margaret . Good girl . Tomorrow , no matter what they do , it 'll be business as usual . Two of the small beef , Mr . Roberts . What is the life blood of any community ? It 's business . Not just big business , but small businesses , like mine . Margaret ! Cups ! We on this island are strong . We 're self- reliant . Sometimes , we 're plain bloody- minded . But we also believe in helping each other . And I don 't mean by state handouts . Margaret , do you want to come to the pictures ? She 's not coming out , she 's got to study . - Miss Hoity- Toity ! Never run with the crowd , Margaret . Go your own way . Go your own way . Never run with the crowd . Open it then . I' ve got a place at Oxford . Don 't let me down , Margaret . Mother ! My hands are still damp . " Margaret Roberts . " Oh ! Tea . - Margaret ! Cups ! They 're talking about you again . Wha ... What time is it ? Sun 's not quite over the yardarm . - It 's time for tea . - Look , Margaret . What have you got on your head ? Found it in the cupboard , and thought , bugger it , it 's Friday , why not fancy dress ? - You look ridiculous . - Boss lady no like ? No , Denis , boss lady no like . She 's made a start , that 's the main thing . No , no , no . It 's going fine . But it 's taken Carol eight years to persuade her to let his things go . Feet ! Well , it 's her pills . You can never be sure she 's taking them . I think sometimes she hides them . Oh , rumbled ! They give her about an hour 's clarity , then she slips again . Can I suggest you remove the sticker from the back of your car ? - Sorry . It 's always cash ... - Then take the sticker off ! I call that false advertising , wouldn 't you ? - I' ve got another ... - I would say keep the change , but there isn 't any change . Hello , June . Any news ? Look , I brought every single bag I could find . He gave a speech recently , trying to come up with a broad base ... Hello , Ma . Bloody taxi driver wouldn 't take my card . I said don 't have a sticker saying you take Visa and then insist on cash . Oh ! Can you believe it ? Rummaging around the bottom of my bag . He didn 't get a tip . I didn 't know that you were dropping by today , dear . Yes , you said yesterday , we were going to start on Dad 's things . The cupboards , then I was going to help you dress . - You 've got Michael and ... - Jacqueline . - Coming for dinner tonight . - Yes , of course . We 're having halibut . This is a major catastrophe that has struck our capital . - As you can see ... - Isn 't it terrible ? They think it 's al- Qaeda . ... are trying to get all the people out of the building . The Prime Minister and his senior staff were due to be staying at the hotel , - but checked out earlier . - Denis ! It 'll be fine . Come get your head down . - It 's ten to three , for God 's sake . - Denis ! At ten to three this morning , an explosion extensively damaged the Grand Hotel in Brighton ... ... Brighton , scene of the Conservative Party conference . ... the Prime Minister and a number of her Cabinet were staying . They escaped unhurt , but it 's reported that ... Five people have died , many others are injured , some critically . The IRA have claimed responsibility . We must release a statement , offering our condolences . I 'm sure they 've already ... We must never , ever , ever give in to terrorists . Is it warm in here ? Now , Ma , are we going long or just below the knee tonight ? Oh , below the knee , I should think . No ! Don 't ... Don 't move those . I haven 't finished sorting . I hear you went out today . You mustn 't go out on your own , Mummy . We 've talked about that . There was no milk . Call Robert , he 'll get it for you if June 's not up . I am not for the knacker 's yet . Now , take it easy , Margaret . - No one 's saying that . If I can 't go out to buy a pint of milk , what is the world coming to ? Really , Carol . Please don 't fuss about it . You 've always been like this , fuss , fuss , fuss . You must find something better to do with your time . It 's most unattractive in a woman . When I was your age , the last thing I wanted to do was fuss around my mother . Four down , nine letters . Something B , something T , something N ... Something , something , something . Refusal to change course . - Obstinate . - What ? - I knew you 'd get it . Ob ... I' ll wear the pearls . I' ll wear the pearls . There they are . My little twins . Thank you , dear . It 's nearly all familiar faces : - William , Michael and his lovely wife . - Jacqueline . And then there 's Peter , James R , James T , and that very nice man we met last year . - I remember . - He 's bringing his new lady friend , just to mix things up a bit , because we 're rather short of women , but I 'm sure we 'll manage . I' ve always preferred the company of men . - Ma ? Ah , Miss Roberts . Hoping to be chosen as our candidate for Parliament . Well , I don 't like coalitions , I never have . Start on the outside , work your way in . Attlee has his sights set on the steel industry , you mark my words . They 'll be nationalizing the bloody air next . Yes , hold your breath , sir . That 's government property . Dreadful . Was your father a political man , too , Miss Roberts ? Oh , yes , to his core . And Mayor of Grantham . - And a grocer as well . - Yes . And did you help ... in the ... - Oh , yes . It was a family business . - ... shop ? A very good starting point for the political life , I 'm sure . That and a degree from Oxford . No , don 't . Whiskey , please . What I do think is that a man should be encouraged to stand on his own two feet . Yes , we help people . Of course we help people . But for those that can do , they must just get up and do . And if something 's wrong , they shouldn 't just whine about it , they should get in there and do something about it , change things . With all due respect , Miss Roberts , what may have served in Grantham ... Can serve very well for the people of Dartford , too . - Really ? - I know much more than those who have never lived on a limited income . Just like the man or woman in the street , when I am short one week , I have to make economies the next . Nothing like a slice of fiscal responsibility . A man might call it fiscal responsibility , a woman might call it good housekeeping . I 'm not sure a home economics lesson is quite what the Dartford constituents need . They see industry being nationalized , the unions on the up , the pound on the slide . Whoever can sort that lot out , he 's my man . - Or woman ? Ladies , shall we ? Miss Roberts , do join the ladies . Well . That 's told us ! So , Margaret , how would you have dealt with this if you 'd been Prime Minister ? Where ? The bombings , Mummy . Today . We were just talking about them . No ... yes . We have always lived alongside evil . But it has never been so patient , so avid for carnage , so eager to carry innocents along with it into oblivion . Hear , hear . Western civilization must root out this evil , wherever it hides , or she risks defeat at the hands of global terror in a nuclear age . Unimaginable . The Prime Minister made a very good statement , I thought . Yes . Clever man . Quite a smoothie . Miss Thatcher , it 's been such a pleasure to meet you . - You don 't mind if I sit down . - No , no . I heard you speak at the conference in Brighton in 1984 , just after the IRA bombed the Grand Hotel . You were remarkable . I hope you appreciate what an inspiration you 've been to women like myself . Well , it used to be about trying to do something . You see . Now , it 's about trying to be someone . - Mm . Anyway , I ... thank you . - Good night , Lady Thatcher . - Good night to you . I am so pleased to see your mother looking so well . - Yes , doesn 't she . - She certainly does . William , great to see you , thank you so much for coming . Thank you . It was lovely , absolutely lovely . - Can I call you a taxi ? - No , no ... OK , hold on to me , that 's right . Ah . Better . Do the clasp . I can 't quite ... - OK . Yes . - Oh , you have an eyelash . - Oh ? - Make a wish . Oh , I spoke to Dr . Michael today . He 's very good . Very expensive . I know you 're not due to see him for another month , but I' ve spoken to him and he can fit you in tomorrow . Just for a checkup . Ma , please . What does Mark think about it ? - Mark ? - Mm . Tell him to come up . I want to talk to him about this . Mark 's with Sarah and the children . Well , tell him to come up and see me after he 's kissed them good night , would you , Carol , darling ? He 's not here , Mummy . Mark lives in South Africa . And you 're not Prime Minister any more . And Dad is , uh ... Dad is dead . You look exhausted , dear . You really must try to get some sleep . Taxis will be few and far between at this hour . Righty oh . Night- night , Ma . Sleep well . Good night , dear . Twenty- four- year- old Miss Margaret Roberts lost her bid to win a seat in Parliament today , but she has put new life into the Dartford Conservative Association . Winning candidate , Mr . Dodds , had better watch out . This bright young woman is on his tail . - Eat . - Oh . Disaster . Hang on . Hang on . Hang on . You shaved thousands off their majority . You did splendidly . Not splendidly enough . Ah , I see . Self- pity . No one 's saying you don 't need a safe seat . You deserve a safe seat . But it does not come unless you learn to play the game a little . - What game ? - You 're a grocer 's daughter . - And proud of being ... - And in their eyes ... ... a single grocer 's daughter . But if you were to become the wife of a moderately successful businessman , then you 'd get to Parliament . And I 'd get to be the happiest man in ... ... wherever they select you . Margaret , will you marry me ? Well ? Yes . Yes ! - Oh ... - What ? I love you so much , but ... ... I will never be one of those women , Denis , who stays silent and pretty on the arm of her husband . Or remote and alone in the kitchen , doing the washing- up , for that matter . We 'll get a help for that . No . One 's life must matter , Denis . Beyond all the cooking and the cleaning and the children , one 's life must mean more than that . I cannot die washing up a tea cup . I mean it , Denis . Say you understand . That 's why I want to marry you , my dear . Oh . Now eat . Oh ! Oh ... There we go . There they are , my little twins . Oh ... Mark . Cornwall , wasn 't it ? Bloody hell . Look at them , little imps . You never really got golf , did you ' ? You look happy . Yes , I do , don 't I ? You 're drinking too much . Whatcha doing ? Not like you , looking back . Don 't want to dig around too deep , M , don 't know what you might find . You can rewind it , but you can 't change it . They grow up so fast , don 't they ? Mark . Oh ... Mr . Eric Deakins , Labor , 13, 437 . Mr . Ivan Spence , Liberal , 12, 260 . - We won ! Mrs . Margaret Thatcher , Conservative , 29, 697 . I can now announce the new Member of Parliament for Finchley , - 1959 ... - Come along , please ! ... Mrs . Margaret Thatcher . Please ! Mummy , don 't go ! You promised ! Hey ! Mummy ! Wait , Mummy ! Please don 't go ! No . Oh ! Mrs . Thatcher . Excuse me . Sorry . Mrs . Thatcher , Airey Neave . Welcome to the madhouse . Follow me . The Honorable Lady , the Member of Parliament for Finchley ! Order ! Order ! The Right Honorable Lady , the Secretary of State for Education . Thank you , Mr . Speaker . The Right Honorable Gentleman knows very well that we had no choice - but to close the schools . - Shame ! - Disgrace ! Because his union paymasters have called a strike deliberately to cripple our economy . - Rubbish ! - Teachers cannot teach when there is no heating , no lighting in their classrooms . And I ask the Right Honorable Gentleman , whose fault is that ? Yours ! Methinks the Right Honorable Lady doth screech too much . And if she wants us to take her seriously , she must learn to calm down ! - Very good ! - If the Right Honorable Gentleman could perhaps attend more closely to what I am saying , rather than how I am saying it , he may receive a valuable education in spite of himself ! Why has ... Why has this Conservative government failed ? - It hasn 't failed . Why has it forced so many in the public sector into taking strike action to save their own jobs ? Minister , the breakdown in essential public services , in transport , in electricity , in sanitation , is not the fault of the trade unions . It 's entirely the fault of the trade unions . But of this Conservative government in which you so shamefully serve ! These power cuts will continue unless we can reach a compromise . The miners are asking for a 35 percent increase in wages . Obviously , we can 't go anywhere near that . The unions are not our enemies and never have been . We want , and have always wanted , the broadest consensus . - Hear , hear . - I 'm sure we are all in agreement that we must do nothing for the moment that will further inflame the current situation . - Hear , hear , Prime Minister . - The fact of the matter is , it 's absolutely crucial that we are seen by the public to be acting as conciliators and not aggressors . Hear , hear . - Yes , Education Secretary . - Yes , Prime Minister . With the miners' union leader today calling for the army to mutiny in support of the strikes , this seems the wrong time for conciliation . Be patient . They 'll come back on again in a moment . - Anybody got a shilling ? - Ah , Boy Scout . Be prepared . Thank you , Margaret . Oh ! It lives . Your thoughts are duly noted . Compromise , compromise , compromise ... We on this island are strong . We 're self- reliant . Napoleon called us a nation of shopkeepers . He meant it as an insult , but to me it 's a compliment . That 's why he couldn 't beat us , that 's why Hitler can 't beat us . We Conservatives believe in giving people the freedom and opportunity to fulfill their own potential , especially the young . There 's no good in pretending we 're all equal , we 're not all the same , never have been , never will be . We should encourage our children to aspire to achieve more than we have , for our children today will be the leaders of tomorrow . It 's 1974 , you 'd think it was World War II . Blackouts , no petrol . It 's a mess . Heath should resign now and make way for someone who 's not afraid to tackle the unions . I swear , it 's all gone completely out of my head . My driving instructor says I should pass , but I feel as if I' ve hardly had any lessons . Which is ridiculous , isn 't it ? - Maybe third time lucky . - Right . The only thing you should remember is that everyone else is either reckless or inept . Usually both . One must be brave if one is to take the wheel . - Right oh . - Right , move . Move to your right a little bit . But if I move to the right , aren 't I on the wrong side of the road ? - Carol ! - Well , he 's in the way ! - To the right . Move to the right ! - Hey ! Look out ! So sorry ! Terribly sorry ! Hey , look at me , driving ! Thanks , Ma , that was terrific ! I really feel like I' ve got a handle on it now . You should have seen us , Pa . Are you trying to cook your own breakfast ? - Denis ! - I can boil a bloody egg . Mummy took me for a test drive . We went absolutely everywhere . All over the place . - Yeah ? - I' ve decided . I 'm going to run . What for ? I 'm going to run for Leader of the Party . - Silly me ! - Good luck ! All the time I thought I was having a driving lesson , it was all about my mother , just for a change ! - What 's she on about ? - Her driving test this morning ! - Oh , right . Of course . - Are you saying you want to be Prime Minister ? Oh ! What I 'm saying is that someone must force the point , someone must say the un- sayable . None of these men have the guts . - The Prime Minister has been very loyal to you , MT . But he 's weak , and he 's weakened the party . One must know when to go . You 're shaking . Here , let me ... I can do it ! Goodness me ! What is the matter with everyone this morning ? I' ve told you what the matter is . The business is a bit rocky at the moment and the doctor says I need a rest . Do you need a rest ? Oh , God . We both know it 's highly unlikely that I would ever be elected leader . I' ll never be elected leader . But I will run . I will run . Just to nip at their heels and make them reaffirm the principles on which - the Conservative Party must stand . There 's so much to do . You 're insufferable , Margaret , do you know that ? Denis , you married someone who is committed to public service , you knew that . - And it is my duty ... - Don 't call it duty . It 's ambition that 's gotten you this far . Ambition . And the rest of us , me , the children , we can all go to hell ! Don 't worry about me , I' ll be fine ! Where did you go ? - South Africa . - Yes . How many days passed before you realized I 'd gone ? Probably had to ask the cleaning woman where I was . When did I lose track of everyone ? - Too busy climbing the greasy pole , MT . - How did I ... ? Mrs . Thatcher , I understand you recently visited - the United States of America . - Oh , oh ... What is it you took away from your visit which may be of value , - here in Great Britain ? - That 's rather easy to answer . They are unafraid of success . We in Great Britain and in Europe are formed mostly by our history . They , on the other hand , are formed by their philosophy . Not by what has been , but by what can be . Oh , we have a great deal that we can learn from them , yes . Oh , yes ! Well ... Uh ... For a start , that hat has got to go . And the pearls . In fact , I think all hats may have to go . You look and sound like a privileged Conservative wife , and we 've already got her vote . You 've got lovely hair , but we need to do something with it , to make it more ... - Important . - Yes . Give it more impact . But the main thing is your voice . It 's too high , and it has no authority . Methinks the lady doth screech too much . People don 't want to be harangued by a woman or hectored . Persuaded , yes . That " Oh , yes , " at the end of the interview , that 's authoritative , that 's the voice of a leader . Quite . It 's all very well to talk about changing my voice , Mr . Reece , but for some of my colleagues to imagine me as their leader ... ... would be like imagining , I don 't know , being led into battle by their chambermaid . It 's my background and my sex . No matter how I' ve tried , and I have tried , to fit in , I know I will never be truly one of them . If I may say so , I think that 's your trump card . You 're flying in the face of everything the Tories have been thus far . It 's really terribly exciting . One simply has to maximize your appeal , bring out all your qualities , and make you look , and sound , like the leader that you could be . You 've got it in you to go the whole distance . Absolutely . What ... Prime Minister ? Oh , no . Oh , no , no , no . In Britain ? There will be no female Prime Minister here , not in my lifetime . No . And I told Airey , I don 't expect to win the leadership , but I am going to run , just to shake up the party . Respectfully , Margaret , I disagree . If you want to change this party , lead it . If you want to change the country , lead it . What we 're talking about here today is surface . What 's crucial is that you hold your course , and stay true to who you are . Never be anything other than yourself . Leave us to do the rest . Gentlemen , I am in your hands . I may be persuaded to surrender the hat . But the pearls were a gift from my husband on the birth of our twins , and , um , they are absolutely non- negotiable . And ... Good , I think we can lose the handbag , Mrs . Thatcher . Yes ? And hands down by side . Right up . Because this isn 't about the voice , it 's about belief . The very core . So a nice deep breath and really fill out against my hands . You 're calling Mr . Thatcher , how would you do that ? - Denis . - Yes , I want authority . - I want conviction , I want ... - Denis . That 's right , one more time , and breathing in . And ... Denis . - Yes , M ! - Sorry . No , no , no . You are the backbone of our nation ! Small firms like Loveday 's Ice Cream . - So nice to meet you , ladies . - Nice to meet you . I' ll just have a small one , because I 'm watching my figure . Whoo ! That 's for you , young man ! I passionately believe that it 's the growth of small businesses into larger ones that is critical for Britain 's future . Well , it has to be something icy on a stick for Denis . That 's the only way that we will produce jobs , real jobs , jobs that sustain . The Trade Union Movement was founded to protect workers . Now it persecutes them . It stops them from working . It is killing jobs and it is bringing this country to its knees . I say enough . It 's time to get up . It 's time to go to work . It 's time to put the " Great " back into Great Britain ! The incompetence of the Labor government ... - ... continue to misinform and spend in this incessant and blasé manner . - We have paid the price ... - Mrs . Thatcher , they 're ready for you . - Thank you . - Give 'em hell . - You look magnificent . Next stop , Prime Minister . - Oh , Airey ... - Let 's go . The new leader of the Conservative Party , - Margaret Thatcher ! Hm ... Good night , Margaret . - Oh ... My money 's on the filly to win . Oh ... Thanks , Airey . Good night . No ! No , no ! No ! Airey ! Ai Fey ! The Irish National Liberation Army has claimed responsibility for the death of MP Airey Neave , Margaret Thatcher 's spokesman on Northern Ireland . If you want to change the party , lead it . If you want to change the country , lead it . You 've got it in you to go the whole distance . - Now , as the test draws near , - I ask your help . That together we can shake off the shackles of Socialism and restore to greatness this country that we love ... And the only way is for the Conservative Party to win ! Is she gonna get there ? Watch those blocks rise ... Go , Maggie ! It 's Friday the 4th of May , an historic day for Britain , a Conservative government led by Mrs . Thatcher is set to lead ... Mrs . Bandaranaike in Sri Lanka , Mrs . Gandhi in India , but never in the West has there ever been a woman Prime Minister . The place that she has now secured in British history , as the first woman ever to be invited to form a government . The bonus of one of the most famous addresses in the world , Number 10 Downing Street . This is it . Steady the buffs , old girl . - Good afternoon . - Congratulations , Prime Minister . - I should just like to say that I take very seriously the trust placed in me by the British people today , and I will work hard every day to live up to that responsibility . And now , I should like to share with you a prayer of St . Francis of Assisi . Where there is discord , may we bring harmony . Where there is error , may we bring truth . Where there is doubt , may we bring faith . And where there is despair , may we bring hope . - Shoulders back , tummies in ! - Thank you , Michael . Look this way , please . Three , two , one . Robert , could you bring the car around ? She 's been ready for ages . I am perfectly healthy . No need for any of this . Just let them look under the bonnet , MT . Make sure everything is hunky dory . Oh , really , this is becoming quite tiresome . - What is ? - You . I was on my own for 24 years before I met you , and I can manage perfectly well without you now . So will you please go away , and stop bothering me ? Just look straight ahead , straight at me , that 's it . - Are you noticing night sweats ? - No . - Hallucinations ? - No . - Sleep ? - Yes . I sleep . Four , five hours a night . So you wake early ? And I stay up late . I always have . We just want to keep abreast of it , that 's all . Yes . Of course . Grief is a very natural state . My husband has been gone for years . Cancer . Carol says you 've decided to let his things go . Probably a good thing . Yes . It was my idea . To Oxfam . Perfectly good stuff . People can use these things . Hm ... Still , it must be a bit disorientating . - You are bound to be feeling ... - What ? What am I " bound to be feeling " ? People don 't think any more . They feel . " How are you feeling ? " " Oh , I don 't feel comfortable . " " Oh , I 'm so sorry , we , the group , we 're feeling ... " Do you know , one of the great problems of our age is that we are governed by people who care more about feelings than they do about thoughts and ideas ? Now , thoughts and ideas , that interests me . Ask me what I am thinking . What are you thinking , Margaret ? Watch your thoughts , for they become words . Watch your words , for they become actions . Watch your actions , for they become habits . Watch your habits , for they become your character . And watch your character , for it becomes your destiny . What we think , we become . My father always said that . And I think I am fine . But I do so appreciate your kind concern . Oh , do please answer that . It might be someone who needs you . I' ll give Carol a quick ring , let her know we 're back , and then I' ll put your electric blanket on . Steady , steady , steady ! Damn . Fore ! What about that medicine man , eh ? Ah . Cold supper . Standards are slipping , Margaret . You really gave it to that quack , didn 't you , darling ? Just like the old days . Hallucinations , my eye ! How dare he ? But then , you give us all the runaround , don 't you ? I know you can hear me , sweetheart , so there 's no use pretending you can 't . Enough . Denis , enough ! Dismissed ! She does it in the end . Kills him . I don 't know why you 're being so scratchy . It 's not as if you 've got anyone else to talk to . " When the Himalayan peasant meets the he- bear in his pride ... " It 's a marvel to me that you can still quote whole chunks of Kipling , but try remembering the name of that woman who just made you that god- awful cold collation . No ? Come on , you can do it . Month of the year . One syllable . Rhymes with moon . - June . - June ! Bingo ! Knew you 'd get there in the end . " When the Himalayan peasant meets the he- bear in his pride , he shouts to scare the monster , who will often turn aside .

Baroness Thatcher made an apparently routine visit to her doctors today . Although rarely seen in public . Britain 's longest- serving Prime Minister of the twentieth century , remains a controversial figure . Almost lovingly dubbed by the Soviets " The Iron Lady , " she is credited , with her friend Ronald Reagan , with a decisive role in the ending of the Cold War . - Margaret ... - Her supporters claim she transformed the British economy and reversed the country 's post- war decline . - I am so sorry . - Her detractors blame her savage public spending cuts and sweeping privatization of ... - I ... don 't recognize myself . Hm ... Am I out of the doghouse yet ? Oh . They 're unveiling that portrait of me at Number 10 next month . Mm . Yes , it 's ... the invitation , it 's on the mantelpiece . So it 'll be Churchill , Lloyd George and me . - Just the three of us . I said I didn 't want any big fuss ... - No . - ... but they insisted . Lovely little article in The Telegraph . " The Woman Who Changed the Face of History . " Huh ... Less than two years ago , the Prime Minister quoted St . Francis ... Yes , and talked about bringing faith , - hope , and harmony to this country . Mm ... Denis ? Can the Right Honorable Lady deny that having brought about the highest level of unemployment since 1934 ... - ... the biggest fall in total output in steel and coal production in one year since 1931 ... and the biggest collapse in industrial production since 1921 ? ! - Order ! Order ! Can she also accept that her free- market economics , designed to create a growing middle class , ensures that the rich get richer and the poor are irrelevant ? ! Out ! Out ! Out ! Maggie ! Maggie ! Maggie ! - Out ! Out ! Out ! - Look at me ! Look at me ! You 're supposed to be a mother ! You 're not a mother , you 're a monster ! You 're a monster ! May we have a word , Prime Minister ? Yes , but in order to arrive at the palace on time , Geoffrey and I are will be walking out of that door in 15 minutes . - As you can see ... - I know you 're running late , Margaret , but we have to address this situation in the light of tomorrow 's blistering press coverage . Blistering ! The knives are out . Your draft budget has been leaked , Geoffrey . They are baying for our blood . Michael , we can 't possibly buckle at the first sign of difficulty . - No one is saying we have to buckle . - But is this really the time to be making these spending cuts in the middle of one of the deepest recessions this country has ever experienced ? - We need a plan of action , Margaret . - Absolutely . A strategy . - We must be armed . - Agreed . There 's a perception , Margaret , rightly or wrongly , that we are now completely out of touch with the country . Really . How much is a pack of Lurpak ? - Lurpak ? - Butter , Francis . Forty- two pence . Anchor butter is 40 pence . Flora margarine , still the cheapest , at 38p . I can assure you I am not out of touch . - Sorry . I didn 't hear you . - What did you say ? - Nothing , Prime Minister . Nothing . No , no , please . Don 't try to hide you opinions . Goodness me , I 'd much rather you were open and straightforward about them , instead of continuously and damagingly leaking them to the press . Well ? - Well ... - People can 't pay their mortgages . The manufacturing industry is practically on its knees . Honest , hard- working , decent people are losing their homes . - It 's terribly shameful . - The point is , Prime Minister , we must moderate the pace ... If we even have a hope of winning the next election . Ah . Worried about our careers , are we ? - Really . - That 's quite absurd . Gentlemen , if we don 't cut spending , we will be bankrupt . Yes , the medicine is harsh , but the patient requires it in order to live . Should we withhold the medicine ? No . We are not wrong . We did not seek election and win in order to manage the decline of a great nation . The people of this country chose us because they believe we can restore the health of the British economy , and we will do just that . Barring a failure of nerve . Anything else ? - Prime Minister . - Prime Minister . You have saved the day once again , Crawfie . You 're an angel . You can 't just close down a conversation because it 's not what you wish to hear . Oh , Geoffrey , I don 't expect everyone to just sit there and agree with me . But what kind of leader am I if I don 't try to get my own way , do what I know to be right ? Yes . But , Margaret ... ... one must be careful not to test one 's colleagues' loyalties too far . We are now one split nation , with a huge gulf dividing the employed from the unemployed . The Thatcher plan is to break the Trade Union Movement . There must be closures of uneconomic coal mines . We seek only an efficient industry . The miners are being starved back to work , the need is desperate ! There are those who would say hold back , there are those who would make us retreat , but we shall never give in to them . We shall never waver , not for a second , in our determination to see this country prosper once again . A car bomb has exploded outside Harrods department store , killing six people and injuring 71 . Eleven soldiers died today when two bombs were detonated during military parades in Hyde Park and Regent 's Park . Seven horses also died in the blast . The IRA have claimed responsibility . And now , it must be business as usual . Come on , love , come to bed . I don 't know why you do this to yourself every year . It 's a speech at conference , not the Magna Carta . Time to call it a day , darling . It 's ten to three , for God 's sake . Oh , I know , I 'm coming , DT . - Come on ... - Nearly there . Denis ! Denis ! Oh , there you are . Are you all right ' ? My shoes ! That 's when I thought I 'd lost you . Mark ? Hello , darling . Oh ... No . No , I 'm fine . I ... I 'm very well . How ... How is , uh ... ... Sarah ? Yes , and the children ? Oh . Oh , you can 't . That 's a pity . Well , I was hoping to see you . Yes . Oh , no , that 's fine . Really , darling . That 's fine . Of course . Another time . Yes , darling . Yes . I can 't wait . Lovely . Yes . Mark ? Mm ... Oh . Oh , dear . That was Mark . Not able to come . That boy 's always going AWOL . Well , it costs him a great deal to fly everyone up here . There you go , making excuses for him . Now look where it 's got you . Did you know that Yul Brynner was a gypsy from Vladivostok ? Yes . Yes , he moved to Paris when he was 14 . And he played the King of Siam 4, 625 times on the London and Broadway stages . - What are you doing ? - One likes to make an effort . - A snifter ? - You 're dead , Denis . - Well , if I 'm dead , who you talking to ? - Shall we dance ? - Oh . Oh ! The Falkland Islands , the British colony in the South Atlantic , has fallen . Argentina claims its marines went ashore as a spearhead this morning to capture key targets , including the capital , Port Stanley . Gentlemen , the Argentinean junta , which is a fascist gang , has invaded our sovereign territory . This cannot be tolerated . May I make plain my negotiating position : I will not negotiate with criminals or thugs . The Falkland Islands belong to Britain , and I want them back . Gentlemen , I need you to tell me today if that is possible . Possible ... just , Prime Minister . We can have a task force ready to sail in 48 hours . - Forty- eight hours . But ? - But ... We have a very narrow weather window . We can 't fight in winter down there , nobody can . If we are going , we have to go now . Why were the islands left without any naval protection ? In the last round of defense cuts , we judged the risk of invasion to be small . Did we ? - And if you remember , Prime Minister , you agreed that we should reduce the naval presence in the area to an absolute minimum . Margaret , the cost of sending 28, 000 men and a hundred ships 12, 000 miles , almost to Argentina , will be absolutely crippling . I don 't think we should be worrying about money at this point , Geoffrey . We can 't afford to go to war . We have to go now . Now . The government has now decided that a large task force will sail , as soon as all preparations are complete . Prime Minister , we do still have three weeks before our ships reach the islands . All we 're saying is that we shouldn 't give up on trying to find a diplomatic solution . The US Secretary of State has arrived , Prime Minister . So you are proposing to go to war over these islands . They are thousands of miles away , a handful of citizens , politically and economically insignificant , if you 'll excuse me . Just like Hawaii ... I imagine . - I 'm sorry ? - 1941 , when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor . Did America go , cap in hand , and ask Tojo for a peaceful negotiation of terms ' ? Did she turn her back on her own citizens there because the islands were thousands of miles away from the mainland United States ? No ! No ! No ! We will stand on principle , or we will not stand at all . But , Margaret , with all due respect , when one has been to war ... With all due respect , sir , I have done battle every single day of my life , and many men have underestimated me before . This lot seem bound to do the same , but they will rue the day . Now , shall I be mother ? Tea , Al , how do you take your tea ? Black or white ? The Argentinean ship the General Belgrano and her escorts are pursuing course 273 degrees towards the Argentinean mainland . We are tracking them with our submarine HMS Conqueror . Is this ship a threat ? Both of these ships are carrying Exocet missiles , Prime Minister . Just yesterday , they launched , then aborted , an attack inside the exclusion zone . There is a risk they could try it again . The Belgrano is sailing directly away from the islands . Can it really be regarded as a threat ? She 's been changing course continually . There 's a strong possibility that they 'll attempt a pincer movement on our carrier group . I advise that we engage them . Hit the Belgrano as a warning to the others , send them all back to port . It 'll play badly internationally . We 'll be seen as aggressors . This will be an escalation , Prime Minister . If there is to be an escalation , it 's better that we start it . It is steaming away , Prime Minister . Sink it . HMS Sheffield , a Type 42 destroyer , was attacked and hit late this afternoon by an Argentine missile . It is seen as retaliation for the sinking of the General Belgrano , in which over 300 Argentinean sailors died . Prime Minister . The latest casualty figures from the Sheffield . - I must write to them . Prime Minister ? The families . I must write to them . A Type 21 frigate , HMS Ardent , was hit by bombs and rockets . Antelope went the way of the other two British ships - lost so far ... - Foreign Secretary . I' ve just been briefed by Admiral Fieldhouse . He told me , bluntly , that if the Argentineans are prepared and willing to risk their aircraft , they have enough Exocet missiles to cripple most of our fleet . President Reagan and President Belaunde of Peru have some new proposals ... ... new proposals for the peace plan . Peace plan ? There will be no appeasement . This is a war . It 's a war they started , but by God , we will finish it . Shall I tell you what I 'm going to Write to every single one of these families , these heartbroken families ? I 'm going to tell them that no British soldier will die in vain ... for the Falklands . Lieutenant Colonel Jones . Captain Wood . Captain Dench . As the only Prime Minister in the history of our country who is also a mother with a son of my own , I can imagine your agony , and your grief . Prime Minister , we have secured the beachhead . The Argentinean troops are demoralized and ill- equipped . The paratroops have taken Goose Green . Shortly after dark last night , our forces surrounding Port Stanley carried out what the Commander in Chief has described as a brilliant surprise night attack . Thatcher , bed . From their new positions , our forces can see large numbers of Argentine soldiers retreating and streaming back into Port Stanley . Our forces are moving forward to exploit their success . - Well done , Margaret . - Congratulations . We congratulate the men and women of our armed forces for their skill , bra very , and loyalty to this country . We were faced with an act of unprovoked aggression , and we responded as we have responded in times past : With unity , strength , and courage ... - ... sure in the knowledge that though much is sacrificed , in the end , right will prevail over wrong . Hear , hear ! And I put it to the Right Honorable Gentleman opposite that this is not a day for him to carp , find fault , demand inquiries . They will happen , I can assure him of that , for we have nothing to hide . No . This is a day to put differences aside , to hold one 's head high and take pride in being British . Hear , hear ! Well done , Prime Minister . Gotcha ! Well , that paid off , old girl ! Your ratings have soared , from the most hated Prime Minister of all time to the nation 's darling . The world at your feet , and Britain was back in business . " I 'm in Love with Margaret Thatcher " ) The Berlin Wall has fallen . The gates have been opened ! The police are making no attempt ... I don 't agree . I don 't agree in any measure . Prime Minister , the question of the European single currency will come up . I don 't think the country is ready for it yet . But we cannot bury our heads in the sand ... A lot of Conservative MP 's and Ministers are saying that there must be a change in that style of management , that Mrs . Thatcher must listen more , and on occasion , give in . The point is , Prime Minister , I don 't think we can sell the idea of a tax that asks everyone to pay the same . Our policies may be unpopular , but they are the right policies . Prime Minister , I just don 't think we can ask the poorest of the poor to pay the same amount of tax as a multi- millionaire . There you go again ! Why not ? - Because ... - Because people , on the whole , think that the tax is manifestly unfair . Nonsense . Errant nonsense . This is a simple proposition . If you live in this country , you must pay for the privilege . Something , anything . If you pay nothing , you care nothing . What do you care where you throw your rubbish ? Your council estate is a mess , your town , graffiti , what do you care ? It 's not your problem , it 's somebody else 's problem . It 's the government 's problem . Your problem , some of you , is that you haven 't got the courage for this fight . No , you haven 't had to fight hard for anything . It 's all been given to you , and you feel guilty about it . Well , may I say , on behalf of those who have had to fight their way up , and who don 't feel guilty about it , we resent those slackers who take , take , take , and contribute nothing to the community . And I see the same thing , the same cowardice in our fight within the European Union , cowardice , for the sovereignty of Britain , the integrity of the pound ! Some of you ... want to make concessions . Some of you want to make concessions . I hear , some of you , agree with the latest French proposals . Well , why don 't you get on a boat to Calais ? Hm ? Why don 't you put on a beret , and pay 85 percent of your income to the French government ! Right . What can we realistically hope to achieve by the end of session , Lord President ? And why have we not made more progress to date ? What is that ? Is that the timetable ? - I haven 't seen that . - It is , Prime Minister . - May I see it ? - Yes , yes , of course . The wording is sloppy here . - And here . - If you say so . - I do say so . - It 's merely a first draft . This is ridiculous . There are two " T 's " in " committee . " Two " T 's . " Geoffrey , this is shameful . Shameful ! I can 't even rely on you ... for a simple timetable . Are you unwell ? Yes , you are unwell . Give me your pencil . Give it to me ! If this is the best you can do , I had better send you to hospital , and I shall do your job as well as my own and everyone else 's . Gentlemen , as the Lord President has chosen to come to Cabinet unprepared ... ... I shall have to close the meeting . Good morning . Can 't pay ! Won 't pay ! Can 't pay ! Won 't pay ! Geoffrey . My letter of resignation . Our differences , I 'm afraid , cannot be reconciled . I have done what I believe to be right for my party and my country . The time has come for others to consider their own response to the tragic conflict of loyalties with which I have myself wrestled ... Geoffrey 's speech in the House of Commons was devastating . He just couldn 't take any more of the bullying . He was almost inviting someone to challenge her for leadership of the party . She behaved appallingly . I wouldn 't have spoken to my gamekeeper like that . I don 't think she can survive this . I 'm here to announce my decision to put my name forward as leader of the Conservative Party . I have nothing but admiration for our Prime Minister , Margaret Thatcher , but I believe our party and our country need a new leader . It 's extraordinary ... - I 'm the Prime Minister . ... make it possible for Conservative MPs to depose - a sitting Prime Minister . - Sweetie . He already has open support . As Conservative MPs gather in Westminster to decide who they will back in the leadership contest , the Prime Minister said she would not be diverted from critical international affairs . Tonight in Paris , Mrs . Thatcher is among 34 world leaders who came here to celebrate the end of the Cold War and to herald the start of a peaceful new age of East- West cooperation . There 's a general feeling that Mrs . Thatcher is going to win on the first ballot . " We 're going to put it to bed tomorrow night , " is how one of her campaign staff puts it . M , I think you should come home and defend yourself , old girl . Heseltine is campaigning ferociously . I do think my time is better spent seeing an end to the Cold War . Don 't you ? After all this time , they know what I stand for . Will she , or will she not , be in the job tomorrow ? Margaret , they can 't touch you . Mrs . Thatcher has failed to win enough votes to secure an outright win in the leadership contest and must now decide whether to put her name forward for the second round . As Mrs . Thatcher leaves Paris for London to make her last- ditch attempt to pull together support for her leadership , the ship may have sailed . Treachery ! We will never win another election led by that woman . We need a leader who listens . This isn 't about her , it 's about the party . One must know when to go . The question is , how does anyone put it to her ? If you were to stand , I , of course , would vote for you , Prime Minister . Prime Minister , I , of course , would vote for you ... But I don 't think you can win . The loyalty of all of my colleagues ... It was the people who put me here . The loyalty of all of my colleagues cannot be counted upon . It 's up to them to tell me when to go . Margaret , you can 't let them do this to you . Please , boss . They 'll destroy you . Throw in the towel now , love . Don 't let those bastards see you humiliated . You just won 't win , darling . Not this time . - Oh , Denis . I am the Prime Minister . Order ! Order ! The Right Honorable Gentleman is afraid . This is their naked strategy of closing some coal mines and then selling off ... They believe in striking , I believe in working ! This is the woman who 's watched ten men on hunger strike starve themselves to death and never ﬂinched ! Despicable and cowardly . - Cynical Falklands war ... - More homeowners , - more shareowners , more savings ... - Showing to the bankers ... Yes , yes , yes ! I offer my resignation after 11 and a half extraordinary years ... ... proud to have left Britain in a much better state than when we took office . What 's this then ? A radio . How useful . Steady , MT . Mrs . Thatcher ! The greatest Prime Minister since Churchill deposed by a bunch of spineless pygmies ! All those years of taking the tough decisions . Does any of it matter now ? It 's all been turned to mush ! - Hm ? - By these fools ! These lily- livered pinkos ! - These inept placaters . Very good ! These vacillators . - Vacillators ! Poll takers . - Popularity seekers . So busy taking the pulse of the public ! - Weak ! Weak ! Weak ! - These weak , weak ... - All of them , weak ! - ... weak men ! Don 't they know if you take the tough decisions ... ... yes , people will hate you today , but they 'll thank you for generations . Or forget you entirely and chuck you out with the rubbish . Oh ! All I wanted was to make a difference in the world . And you did , love , you did . Yes ... Oh ... All I wanted was for my children to grow up well and be happy , happier than I was , certainly . He kept all this . Oh , yes . And I wanted you to be happy , of course . Were you happy , Denis ? Tell me the truth . Denis ? Denis ? Denis ? Here 's your bag . All packed , sorted . Denis , wait . Where are your shoes ? You ... You can 't go without your shoes . - Not yet . - Steady . Yes . Steady . - Steady the buffs . - Steady the buffs . No . Not yet ! Denis ! Wait ! I don 't ... I said I don 't want you to go yet . Denis ! Please ! Not ... Don 't ... No . I 'm not ... I don 't want to be on my own . You 're gonna be fine on your own , love . You always have been . Denis ... No , no , no ! Mummy . - Good God ! - Mum , are you all right ? - Yes . - What have you been doing ? Mummy , you should have called for help , silly old sausage . Have you not even been in your bed properly ? You 've done all this ? Yes , it 's all sorted . Finished . Yes , well , don 't worry about that . June and I can crack on with it . I was just going to get dressed . Shall I call someone , see if anyone can come and do your hair ? No ... You do it . Right , I 'm off , June . Susie 's going to drive me . - Just loading the car . - OK . Bye ! Oh , let me do that , Margaret . No , dear , it 's all right . I' ll do it . Carol said you might go to the House of Lords today ? - No , no . I 'm not going anywhere . Are you here to kill me ? I know what this is . I 've seen one before . Many , many years ago . It belonged to a man I met in a half-remembered dream . A man possessed of some radical notions . What is the most resilient parasite ? A bacteria ? A virus ? An intestinal worm ? Uh ... What Mr . Cobb is trying to say -- An idea . Resilient . Highly contagious . Once an idea has taken hold of the brain , it 's almost impossible to eradicate . An idea that is fully formed , fully understood , that sticks . Right in there somewhere . For someone like you to steal ? Yes . In the dream state , your conscious defenses are lowered ... and that makes your thoughts vulnerable to theft . It 's called extraction . Mr . Saito , we can train your subconscious to defend itself ... from even the most skilled extractor . How can you do that ? Because I am the most skilled extractor . I know how to search your mind and find your secrets . I know the tricks . And I can teach them to you , so that even when you 're asleep ... your defense is never down . Look , if you want my help , you 're gonna have to be completely open with me . I need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife ... better than your therapist , better than anyone . If this is a dream , and you have a safe full of secrets ... I need to know what 's in that safe . In order for this all to work , you need to completely let me in . Enjoy your evening , gentlemen , as I consider your proposal . He knows . What 's going on up there ? Saito knows . He 's playing with us . Does n't matter . I can get it here . Trust me . The information is in the safe . He looked right at it when I mentioned secrets . What 's she doing here ? Just head back to the room . All right ? I 'll take care of this . Okay , make sure you do . We 're here to work . If I jumped , would I survive ? With a clean dive , perhaps . Mal , what are you doing here ? I thought you might be missing me . You know that I am . But I ca n't trust you anymore . So what ? Looks like Arthur 's taste . Actually , the subject is partial to postwar British painters . Please , have a seat . Tell me ... do the children miss me ? You ca n't imagine . What are you doing ? Just getting some fresh air . Stay where you are , Mal . Goddamn it . Turn around . The gun , Dom . Please . Now the envelope , Mr . Cobb . Did she tell you ? Or have you known all along ? That you 're here to steal from me , or that we are actually asleep ? I want to know the name of your employer . Ah , there 's no use threatening him in a dream , right , Mal ? That depends on what you 're threatening . Killing him would just wake him up . But pain ... Pain is in the mind . And judging by the decor , we 're in your mind , are n't we , Arthur ? - What are you doing ? It 's too soon . - But the dream 's collapsing . I 'm gonna try to keep Saito under a little bit longer . We 're almost there . He was close . Very close . Stop him ! This is n't gonna work . Wake him up . He wo n't wake . - Give him the kick . - What ? Dunk him . He 's out . You came prepared , hmm ? Not even my head of security knows this apartment . How did you find it ? It 's difficult for a man of your position to keep a love nest like this secret ... particularly where there 's a married woman involved . - She would never ... - Yet here we are . - With a dilemma . - They 're getting closer . - You got what you came for . - Well , that 's not true . You left out a key piece of information , did n't you ? You held something back because you knew what we were up to . - Question is , why 'd you let us in at all ? - An audition . - An audition for what ? - Does n't matter . You failed . We extracted every bit of information you had in there . But your deception was obvious . - So leave me and go . - You do n't seem to understand , Mr . Saito . That corporation that hired us , they wo n't accept failure . We wo n't last two days . Cobb ? Looks like I 'm gonna have to do this a little more simply . Tell us what you know ! Tell us what you know , now ! I 've always hated this carpet . It 's stained and frayed in such distinctive ways . But very definitely made of wool . Right now ... I m lying on polyester . Which means I m not lying on my carpet , in my apartment . You have lived up to your reputation , Mr . Cobb . I 'm still dreaming . - How 'd it go ? - Not good . Dream within a dream , huh ? I 'm impressed . But in my dream , you play by my rules . Ah , yes , but you see , Mr . Saito ... We 're not in your dream . We 're in mine . Asshole . How do you mess up the carpet ? - It was n't my fault . - You 're the architect . I did n't know he was gonna rub his cheek on it ! That 's enough . You . What the hell was all that ? - I have it under control . - I 'd hate to see you out of control . We do n't have time for this . I 'm getting off at Kyoto . He 's not gonna check every compartment . Yeah , well , I do n't like trains . Listen . Every man for himself . Yes , hello ? - Hi , Daddy . - Hi , Dad . Hey , guys . Hey . How are you ? How you doing , huh ? - Good . - Okay , I guess . Okay ? Who 's just okay ? Is that you , James ? Yeah . When are you coming home , Dad ? Well , I ca n't , sweetheart . I ca n't . Not for a while , remember ? Why ? Look , I told you , I m away because I m working , right ? Grandma says you 're never coming back . Phillipa , is that you ? Put Grandma on the phone for me , will you ? She 's shaking her head . Well , just hope she 's wrong about that . Daddy ? Yeah , James ? Is Mommy with you ? James , we talked about this . Mommy 's not here anymore . Where ? That 's enough , kids . Say bye-bye . Listen , I m gonna send some presents with Grandpa , all right ? And you be good , you be -- - Our ride 's on the roof . - Right . Hey , are you okay ? Yeah . Yeah , I m fine . Why ? Well , down in the dream , Mal showing up . Look , I m , uh , sorry about your leg . Wo n't happen again . - It 's getting worse , is n't it ? - One apology 's all you 're getting , all right ? - Where 's Nash ? - He has n't shown . You wanna wait ? We were supposed to deliver Saito 's expansion plans ... to Cobol Engineering two hours ago . By now , they know we failed . It 's time we disappear . - Where you gonna go ? - Buenos Aires . I can lie low there , maybe sniff out a job when things quiet down . You ? Stateside . Send my regards . He sold you out . Thought to come to me and bargain for his life . So I offer you the satisfaction . It 's not the way I deal with things . - What will you do with him ? - Nothing . But I ca n't speak for Cobol Engineering . - What do you want from us ? - Inception . - Is it possible ? - Of course not . If you can steal an idea from someone 's mind ... why ca n't you plant one there instead ? Okay , here 's me planting an idea in your head . I say , Do n't think about elephants . What are you thinking about ? Elephants . Right . But it 's not your idea , because you know I gave it to you . The subject 's mind can always trace the genesis of the idea . - True inspiration 's impossible to fake . - That 's not true . - Can you do it ? - Are you offering me a choice ? Because I can find my own way to square things with Cobol . Then you do have a choice . Then I choose to leave , sir . Tell the crew where you want to go . Hey , Mr . Cobb . How would you like to go home ? To America . To your children . You ca n't fix that . No one can . - Just like inception . - Cobb , come on . - How complex is the idea ? - Simple enough . No idea is simple when you need to plant it in somebody else 's mind . My main competitor is an old man in poor health . His son will soon inherit control of the corporation . I need him to decide to break up his father 's empire . - Cobb , we should walk away from this . - Hold on . If I were to do this , if I even could do it ... I d need a guarantee . - How do I know you can deliver ? - You do n't . But I can . So do you want to take a leap of faith ... or become an old man , filled with regret ... waiting to die alone ? Assemble your team , Mr . Cobb . And choose your people more wisely . Look , I know how much you wanna go home . This ca n't be done . Yes , it can . Just have to go deep enough . You do n't know that . I 've done it before . Who 'd you do it to ? Why are we going to Paris ? We 're gonna need a new architect . You never did like your office , did you ? No space to think in that broom cupboard . Is it safe for you to be here ? Extradition between France and the United States ... is a bureaucratic nightmare , you know that . I think they might find a way to make it work in your case . Look , I , uh , brought these for you to give to the kids when you have a chance . It 'll take more than the occasional stuffed animal ... to convince those children they still have a father . I 'm just doing what I know . I 'm doing what you taught me . I never taught you to be a thief . No , you taught me to navigate people 's minds . But after what happened ... there were n't a whole lot of legitimate ways for me to use that skill . What are you doing here , Dom ? I think I found a way home . It 's a job for some very , very powerful people . People who I believe can fix my charges permanently . But I need your help . You 're here to corrupt one of my brightest and best . You know what I m offering . Let them decide for themselves . - Money . - Not just money . You remember . It 's the chance to build cathedrals , entire cities ... things that never existed ... things that could n't exist in the real world . So you want me to let someone else follow you into your fantasy ? They do n't actually come into the dream . They just design the levels and teach them to the dreamers . That 's all . Design it yourself . Mal wo n't let me . Come back to reality , Dom . - Please . - Reality . Those kids , your grandchildren ... they 're waiting for their father to come back home . That 's their reality . And this job , this last job , that 's how I get there . I would not be standing here if I knew any other way . I need an architect who 's as good as I was . I 've got somebody better . Ariadne ? I 'd like you to meet Mr . Cobb . Pleased to meet you . If you have a few moments , Mr . Cobb has a job offer he 'd like to discuss with you . A work placement ? Not exactly . I have a test for you . You 're not gonna tell me anything first ? Before I describe the job , I have to know you can do it . - Why ? - It s not , strictly speaking , legal . You have two minutes to design a maze that it takes one minute to solve . Stop . Again . Stop . You 're gonna have to do better than that . That 's more like it . They say we only use a fraction of our brain 's true potential . Now , that 's when we 're awake . When we 're asleep , our mind can do almost anything . Such as ? Imagine you 're designing a building . You consciously create each aspect . But sometimes , it feels like it 's almost creating itself , if you know what I mean . Yeah , like I 'm discovering it . Genuine inspiration , right ? Now , in a dream , our mind continuously does this . We create and perceive our world simultaneously . And our mind does this so well that we do n't even know it 's happening . That allows us to get right in the middle of that process . - How ? - By taking over the creating part . Now , this is where I need you . You create the world of the dream . We bring the subject into that dream , and they fill it with their subconscious . How could I ever acquire enough detail to make them think that it 's reality ? Well , dreams , they feel real while we 're in them , right ? It 's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange . Let me ask you a question . You never really remember the beginning of a dream , do you ? You always wind up right in the middle of what 's going on . I guess , yeah . So how did we end up here ? Well , we just came from the , uh ... Think about it , Ariadne . How did you get here ? Where are you right now ? We 're dreaming ? You 're in the middle of the workshop , sleeping . This is your first lesson in shared dreaming . Stay calm . If it 's just a dream , then why are you -- ? Because it 's never just a dream , is it ? And a face full of glass hurts like hell . When you 're in it , it feels real . That 's why the military developed dream sharing . It was a training program for soldiers to shoot , stab and strangle each other ... and then wake up . How did architects become involved ? Well , someone had to design the dreams , right ? Why do n't you give us another five minutes ? Five minutes ? What -- ? We were talking for , like , at least an hour . In a dream , your mind functions more quickly ... therefore time seems to feel more slow . Five minutes in the real world gives you an hour in the dream . Why do n't you see what you can get up to in five minutes ? You 've got the basic layout . Bookstore , café . Almost everything else is here too . Who are the people ? - Projections of my subconscious . - Yours ? - Yes . Remember , you are the dreamer . You build this world . I am the subject . My mind populates it . You can literally talk to my subconscious . That 's one of the ways we extract information from the subject . How else do you do it ? By creating something secure , like a bank vault or a jail . The mind automatically fills it with information it 's trying to protect . - You understand ? - Then you break in and steal it ? Well ... I guess I thought that the dream space would be all about the visual ... but it 's more about the feel of it . My question is what happens when you start messing with the physics of it all ? It 's something , is n't it ? Yes , it is . Why are they all looking at me ? Because my subconscious feels that someone else is creating this world . The more you change things , the quicker the projections start to converge on you . Converge ? They sense the foreign nature of the dreamer . They attack , like white blood cells fighting an infection . - What , they 're gonna attack us ? - No , no . Just you . This is great , but I m telling you , if you keep changing things like this ... Jeez , mind telling your subconscious to take it easy ? It 's my subconscious . Remember ? I ca n't control it . Very impressive . I know this bridge . This place is real , is n't it ? Yeah , I cross it every day to get to the college . Never re-create places from your memory . Always imagine new places . You draw from stuff you know , right ? Only use details . A streetlamp or a phone booth . Never entire areas . - Why not ? - Building a dream from your memory ... is the easiest way to lose your grasp on what 's real and what is a dream . - Is that what happened to you ? - Listen to me . This has nothing to do with me , understand ? That why you need me to build your dreams ? Hey , get off of her . Back up . Back up . - Cobb ! Cobb ! - Get off of her ! - Let me go ! Let me go ! - Mal ! - Mal ! - Cobb ! Wake me up ! - Wake me up ! Wake me up ! - No ! - Mal , no ! No ! - Wake me up ! Hey , hey , hey . Look at me . You 're okay . You 're okay . - Hey . - Why would n't I wake up ? There was still time on the clock . You ca n't wake up from within the dream unless you die . -- She 'll need a totem . - What ? A totem , it 's a small personal -- That 's some subconscious you 've got on you , Cobb ! - She 's a real charmer . - Oh . - I see you met Mrs . Cobb . - She 's his wife ? Yeah . So a totem . You need a small object , potentially heavy . Something you can have on you that no one else knows . - Like a coin ? - No . It needs to be more unique than that . Like , this is a loaded die . No , I ca n't let you touch it . That would defeat the purpose . See , only I know the balance and the weight of this particular loaded die . That way , when you look at your totem ... you know beyond a doubt that you 're not in someone else 's dream . I do n't know if you ca n't see what 's going on , or if you just do n't want to ... but Cobb has some serious problems that he 's tried to bury down there . And I m not about to just open my mind to someone like that . She 'll be back . I 've never seen anyone pick it up that quickly before . Reality 's not gonna be enough for her now , and when she comes back ... When she comes back , you 're gonna have her building mazes . - Where are you gonna be ? - I gotta go visit Eames . Eames ? No , he 's in Mombasa . It 's Cobol 's back yard . It 's a necessary risk . - Well , there 's plenty of good thieves . - We do n't just need a thief . We need a forger . Rub them together all you want , they 're not gonna breed . You never know . I 'm gonna get you a drink . You 're buying . - Your spelling has n't improved . - Piss off . How 's your handwriting ? - It s versatile . - Good . Thank you very much . Inception . Now , before you bother telling me it 's impossible , let me-- No , it 's perfectly possible . It 's just bloody difficult . Interesting . Because Arthur keeps telling me it ca n't be done . Hmm . Arthur . You still working with that stick in the mud ? He is good at what he does , right ? Oh , he 's the best , but he has no imagination . Not like you . Listen , if you 're gonna perform inception , you need imagination . Let me ask you something . Have you done it before ? We tried it . Uh , we got the idea in place , but it did n't take . - You did n't plant it deep enough ? - No , it 's not just about depth . You need the simplest version of the idea ... in order for it to grow naturally in your subject 's mind . It s a subtle art . So , what is this idea that you need to plant ? We need the heir of a major corporation to dissolve his father 's empire . Right there you have various political motivations ... and anti-monopolistic sentiments and so forth . But all of that stuff , it 's , um ... It 's really at the mercy of your subject 's prejudice , you see ? What you have to do is start at the absolute basic . Which is what ? The relationship with the father . - Do you have a chemist ? - No , not yet . Right . Okay , well , there 's a man here , Yusuf . He , uh , formulates his own versions of the compounds . Why do n't you take me there ? Once you 've lost your tail . The man at the bar . Cobol Engineering . That price on my head , was that dead or alive ? Do n't remember . Let 's see if he starts shooting . Run interference . I 'll meet you downstairs in the bar in , say , uh , half an hour ? - Back here ? - This is the last place they 'd suspect . All right . Freddy . Freddy Simmonds . My God , it 's you , is n't it ? No , it is n't you . Not dreaming now , are you ? Get him ! There ! One café . Shh . One café . One café . Care for a lift , Mr . Cobb ? - What are you doing in Mombasa ? - I m here to protect my investment . Ah . So this is your idea of losing a tail , huh ? Different tail . Cobb said you 'd be back . - I tried not to come , but ... - But there 's nothing quite like it . It 's just ... pure creation . Shall we take a look at some paradoxical architecture ? You 're gonna have to master a few tricks ... if you 're gonna build three complete dream levels . Excuse me . What kind of tricks ? In a dream , you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes . That lets you create closed loops , like the Penrose Steps . The infinite staircase . See ? Paradox . So a closed loop like that ... will help you disguise the boundaries of the dream you create . But how big do these levels have to be ? It could be anything from the floor of a building to an entire city . They have to be complicated enough that we can hide from the projections . - A maze ? - Right , a maze . And the better the maze ... Then the longer we have before the projections catch us ? Exactly . - My subconscious seems polite enough . - Ha , ha . You wait , they 'll turn ugly . No one likes to feel someone else messing around in their mind . Cobb ca n't build anymore , can he ? I do n't know if he ca n't , but he wo n't . He thinks it 's safer if he does n't know the layouts . Why ? He wo n't tell me . But I think it 's Mal . - His ex-wife ? - No , not his ex . - They 're still together ? - No . No , she 's dead . What you see in there is just his projection of her . What was she like in real life ? She was lovely . - You are seeking a chemist ? - Yes . To formulate compounds for a job ? And to go into the field with us . No , I rarely go into the field , Mr . Cobb . Well , we 'd need you there to tailor compounds specific to our needs . - Which are ? - Great depth . A dream within a dream ? Two levels ? Three . Not possible . That many dreams within dreams is too unstable . It is possible . You just have to add a sedative . A powerful sedative . - How many team members ? - Five . Six . The only way to know you 've done the job is if I go in with you . There 's no room for tourists on a job like this , Mr . Saito . This time , it seems there is . This , I think , is a good place to start . I use it every day . What for ? - Here , I 'll show you . Perhaps you will not want to see . After you . Ten . Twelve . All connected . Bloody hell . They come every day to share the dream . You see ? Very stable . - How long do they dream for ? - Three , four hours , each day . In dream time ? With this compound ? About 40 hours , each and every day . - Why do they do it ? - Tell him , Mr . Cobb . After a while , it becomes the only way you can dream . Do you still dream , Mr . Cobb ? - They come here every day to sleep ? - No . They come to be woken up . The dream has become their reality . Who are you to say otherwise , sir ? Let 's see what you can do . You know how to find me . You know what you have to do . Sharp , no ? Are you all right , Mr . Cobb ? Yeah , yeah . Everything 's just fine . Robert Fischer , heir to the Fischer Morrow energy conglomerate . What 's your problem with this Mr . Fischer ? That 's not your concern . Mr . Saito , this is n't your typical corporate espionage . You asked me for inception . I do hope you understand the gravity of that request . Now , the seed that we plant in this man 's mind will grow into an idea . This idea will define him . It may come to change ... Well , it may come to change everything about him . We 're the last company standing between them and total energy dominance . And we can no longer compete . Soon , they 'll control the energy supply of half the world . In effect , they become a new superpower . The world needs Robert Fischer to change his mind . That 's where we come in . How is Robert Fischer 's relationship with his father ? Rumor is the relationship is quite complicated . Well , we ca n't work based solely on rumor , can we ? Can you get me access to this man here ? Browning . Fischer Senior 's right-hand man . Fischer Junior 's godfather . It should be possible , if you can get the right references . References are something of a specialty for me , Mr . Saito . I 'm not smelling settlement here . Take them down . Mr . Browning ... Maurice Fischer 's policy is always one of avoiding litigation . Well , shall we voice your concerns with Maurice directly ? Not sure that 's necessary . No , no , no . I think we should . How is he ? I do n't want to bother him unnecessarily , but -- Robert , I told you keep out the damn -- Wait . So do it . Get -- - Mr . Fischer . - Put it through . Never , never . Never do the same as I asked . Leave that . Here . Must be a cherished memory of his . I put it beside his bed . He has n't even noticed . Robert ... we need to talk about a power of attorney . - I know this is hard , but it 's imperative-- - Not now , Uncle Peter . The vultures are circling . And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes , the more powerful Peter Browning becomes . I 've had ample opportunity to observe Browning ... and adopt his physical presence , study his mannerisms , and so on and so forth . So now in the first layer of the dream , I can impersonate Browning . And suggest concepts to Fischer 's conscious mind . Then , when we take him a level deeper ... his own projection of Browning should feed that right back to him . So he gives himself the idea . Precisely . That 's the only way it will stick . It has to seem self-generated . Eames , I am impressed . Your condescension , as always , is much appreciated , Arthur , thank you . Were you going under on your own ? No , no , I was just , uh , running some experiments . I did n't realize anyone was here , so ... Yeah , I was just -- I was working on my totem , actually . Here , let me take a look . So you 're learning , huh ? An elegant solution for keeping track of reality . - Was it your idea ? - No , it was , uh ... It was Mal 's , actually . This ... This one was hers . She would spin it in the dream and it would never topple . Just spin and spin . Arthur told me she passed away . How are the mazes coming along ? Each level relates to the part of the subject 's subconscious ... that we are trying to access . So I m making the bottom level a hospital , so Fischer will bring his father . You know , I -- Actually , I have a question about this layout . No , no , no . Do n't show me specifics . Only the dreamer should know the layout . Why is that so important ? In case one of us brings in our projections . We do n't want them knowing the details of the maze . You mean in case you bring Mal in . You ca n't keep her out , can you ? - Right . - You ca n't build ... because if you know the maze , then she knows it . Well , she 'd sabotage the whole operation . - Cobb , do the others know ? - No . No , they do n't . You 've gotta warn them if this is getting worse . No one said it 's getting worse . I need to get home . That 's all I care about right now . Why ca n't you go home ? Because they think I killed her . - Thank you . - For what ? For not asking whether I did . I will split up my father 's empire . Now , this is obviously an idea that Robert himself would choose to reject ... which is why we need to plant it deep in his subconscious . The subconscious is motivated by emotion , right ? Not reason . We need to find a way to translate this into an emotional concept . How do you translate business strategy into emotion ? That 's what we 're here to figure out . Robert 's relationship with his father ... - ... is stressed , to say the least . - Can we run with that ? We suggest breaking up his father 's company as a screw you to the old man . No , because I think positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time . We all yearn for reconciliation , for catharsis . We need Robert Fischer to have a positive emotional reaction to all this . All right , well , try this . Um ... My father accepts that I want to create for myself , not follow in his footsteps . That might work . Might ? We 're gonna need to do a little better than might . Thank you for your contribution , Arthur . Forgive me for wanting a little specificity , Eames . Specificity ? Inception 's not about being specific . When we get inside his mind , we 're gonna have to work with what we find . On the top level , we open up his relationship with his father ... and say , I will not follow in my father 's footsteps . Then the next level down , we feed him , I will create something for myself . Then , by the time we hit the bottom level , we bring out the big guns . - My father does n't want me to be him . - Exactly . Three layers down , the dreams are gonna collapse with the slightest disturbance . Sedation . For sleep stable enough to create three layers of dreaming ... we 'll have to combine it with an extremely powerful sedative . Good night . The compound we 'll be using to share the dream ... creates a clear connection between dreamers ... - ... whilst accelerating brain function . - In other words , more time on each level . Brain function in the dream will be about 20 times normal . And when you enter a dream within that dream , the effect is compounded . It 's three dreams , that 's 10 hours times 20 -- Math was never my strong subject . How much time is that ? It 's a week , the first level down . Six months the second level down , and the third level -- That 's 10 years . Who 'd wanna be stuck in a dream for 10 years ? Depends on the dream . So once we 've made the plant , how do we get out ? I 'm hoping you have something more elegant than shooting me in the head . - A kick . - What 's a kick ? This , Ariadne , would be a kick . It 's that feeling of falling you get that jolts you awake . - Snaps you out of the dream . - We gonna feel a kick with this sedation ? That 's the clever part . I customized the sedative to leave inner-ear function unimpaired . That way , however deep the sleep , the sleeper still feels falling . Or tipping . The trick is to synchronize a kick that can penetrate all three levels . We could use a musical countdown to synchronize the different kicks . He has n't got any surgery scheduled , no dental , nothing . Was n't he supposed to have a knee operation ? Nothing . Nothing that they 'll put him under for , anyway . And we need-- We need at least a good 10 hours . Sydney to Los Angeles . One of the longest flights in the world . He makes it every two weeks . He must be flying private , then . Not if there were unexpected maintenance with his plane . It would have to be a 747 . - Why 's that ? On a 747 , the pilot 's up top ... the first-class cabin 's in the nose , so no one would walk through . You 'd have to buy out the entire cabin and the first-class flight attendant . I bought the airline . It seemed neater . Well , looks like we have our 10 hours . Ariadne ? Terrific work , by the way . You know how to find me . You know what you have to do . You remember when you asked me to marry you ? Of course I do . You said you had a dream . That we 'd grow old together . And we can . You should n't be here . Just wanted to see what kind of tests you 're doing on your own every night . - This has nothing to do with you . - This has everything to do with me . - You 've asked me to share dreams with you . - Not these . These are my dreams . Why do you do this to yourself ? It 's the only way I can still dream . Why is it so important to dream ? In my dreams , we 're still together . These are n't just dreams . These are memories . And you said never to use memories . I know I did . You 're trying to keep her alive . You ca n't let her go . You do n't understand . These are moments I regret . They 're memories that I have to change . Well , what 's down there that you regret ? Listen , there 's only one thing you need to understand about me . This is your house ? Mine and Mal 's , yes . Where is she ? She 's already gone . That 's my son , James . He 's digging for something , maybe a worm . That 's Phillipa . I thought about calling out to them ... so they 'd turn and smile and I could see ... those beautiful faces of theirs , but it 's all too late . Right now or never , Cobb . Then I start to panic . I realize I 'm gonna regret this moment ... that I need to see their faces one last time . James ! Phillipa ! Come on in ! But the moment 's past . And whatever I do , I ca n't change this moment . As I m about to call out to them ... they run away . If I m ever gonna see their faces again , I 've gotta get back home . The real world . What are you doing here ? My name is -- I know who you are . What are you doing here ? I 'm just trying to understand . How could you understand ? Do you know what it is to be a lover ? To be half of a whole ? No . I 'll tell you a riddle . You 're waiting for a train . A train that will take you far away . You know where you hope this train will take you ... but you do n't know for sure . But it does n't matter . How can it not matter to you where that train will take you ? Because you 'll be together . How could you bring her here , Dom ? - What is this place ? This is a hotel suite where we used to spend our anniversary . What happened here ? You promised ! You promised we 'd be together ! Please , I need you to stay here just for now ! You said we 'd be together ! You said we 'd grow old together ! I 'll come back for you . I promise . Do you think you can just build a prison of memories to lock her in ? Do you really think that that 's gonna contain her ? It 's time . Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney . - When 's the funeral ? - Thursday . In Los Angeles . Robert should accompany the body no later than Tuesday . We should move . All right . - Cobb , I m coming with you . - I promised Miles . No . The team needs someone who understands what you 're struggling with . And it does n't have to be me ... but then you have to show Arthur what I just saw . Get us another seat on the plane . lf I get on this plane and you do n't honor our agreement ... when we land , I go to jail for the rest of my life . Complete the job en route ... I make one phone call from the plane ... you have no trouble getting through Immigration . - I m sorry . - Oh , yeah , absolutely . Thank you . Excuse me , I think this is yours ? You must have dropped it . Would you care for a drink ? Oh . Water , please . Oh , um , same , please . Um ... Thank you . You know , I could n't help but notice ... but you would n't happen to be related to the Maurice Fischer , would you ? Yes , he , um ... He was my father . Well , he was a very inspiring figure . I 'm sorry for your loss . - Here you go . - Thank you . Hey . To your father . May he rest in peace , huh ? - Could n't have peed before you went under ? - Sorry . Bit too much free champagne before takeoff ? Ha , ha , bloody ha . We know he 's gonna be looking for a taxi in this weather . - Asshole ! Hey , man , why do n't you try -- ? - Walk away . Just have him ca -- I gotta go . All right . Taxi . Thank you . All right , Third and Market . Snappy . - What are you doing ? - Sorry , I thought it was free . - It s not . - Maybe we could share . Maybe not . Can you pull over and get this -- ? Great . Come on . There 's 500 in there . The wallet 's worth more than that . You might at least drop me at my stop . I 'm afraid that it does n't -- - Cover him ! - Down ! Down now ! What the hell is going on ? This was n't in the design . Cobb ? Cobb ? Get him ! Are you all right ? Yeah , I m okay . I 'm okay . Fischer 's okay , unless he gets carsick . Saito ? Get Fischer in the back room now . - Get him in the back room . Move . - What the hell happened ? Has he been shot ? Is he dying ? I do n't know . - Jesus Christ . What happened to you ? - Blocked by a freight train . Why put a train in a downtown intersection ? - I did n't . - Where 'd it come from ? Why the hell were we ambushed ? Those were not normal projections . They 'd been trained , for God 's sakes . - How could he be trained ? - Fischer 's had an extractor ... teach his subconscious to defend itself , so his subconscious is militarized . It should 've shown in the research . Why the hell did n't it ? - Calm down . Do n't tell me to calm down ! This was your job , goddamn it ! This was your responsibility ! You were meant to check Fischer 's background ! - We are not prepared for this ! - We have dealt with sub-security before ! We 'll be more careful and we 're gonna be fine ! This was not a part of the plan ! He 's dying . Put him out his misery . - No , do n't do that ! Do n't do that . - Cobb , hey , hey . He 's in agony . I m waking him up . No . It wo n't wake him up . What do you mean , it wo n't wake him up ? When we die in a dream , we wake up . Not from this . We 're too heavily sedated to wake up that way . Right . So , what happens when we die ? - We drop into limbo . - Are you serious ? - Limbo ? - Unconstructed dream space . What the hell is down there ? - Just raw , infinite subconscious . Nothing is down there , except for what might have been left behind ... by anyone sharing the dream who 's been trapped there before . Which , in our case , is just you . - How long could we be stuck ? - Ca n't even think about ... - ... trying to escape until the sedation -- - How long ? Decades . It could be infinite . Ask him , he 's the one who 's been there . Let 's get him upstairs . Great . Thank you . So now we 're trapped in Fischer 's mind , battling his own private army . And if we get killed ... we 'll be lost in limbo till our brains turn to scrambled egg , hmm ? Someone got first aid ? - You knew these risks and did n't tell us ? - There were n't meant to be risks . - I did n't know we 'd be dealing with gunfire . - You had no right . This was the only way to go three layers deep . You knew about this and went along with it ? I trusted him . When ? When he promised you half his share ? No . His whole share . Besides , he said he 'd done it before . What , with Mal ? Because that worked so good ? That has nothing to do with it . I did what I had to to get to my children . You led us into a war zone with no way out ? There is a way out . We continue on with the job , and we do it as fast as possible ... and we get out using the kick , just like before . Forget it . We go any deeper , we just raise the stakes . I am sitting this one out on this level . Fischer 's security is surrounding this place . Ten hours of flight time is a week at this level . That means each and every one of us will be killed . That I can guarantee you . We have no other choice but to continue on and do it as fast as possible . Downwards is the only way forwards . Get ready . You , come on . Let 's go shake him up . I 'm insured against kidnapping for up to 10 million . - This should be very simple . - Shut up ! It wo n't be . In your father 's office , below the bookshelves ... is his personal safe . We need the combination . I do n't know any safe . That does n't mean you do n't know the combination . Tell us what it is . I do n't know . We have it on good authority you do know . Yeah ? Whose authority ? - Five hundred dollars , this cost . - What 's inside it ? Cash , cards , ID . And this . Useful ? Maybe . You 're on . You 've got an hour . An hour ? I was supposed to have all night to crack this . And Saito was n't supposed to be shot in the chest . You 've got one hour , now get us something useful , please . - What 's that ? - Good authority . Uncle Peter . Just make them stop . - The combination . - I do n't know it . - Why does Browning say you do ? - I do n't know . Just let me talk to him and I ll find out . You have one hour . Start talking . You all right ? You okay ? Those bastards have had at me for two days . They have someone with access to your father 's office . - They 're trying to open his safe . - Yeah . They thought I 'd know the combination , but I do n't know it . - Yeah , well , neither do I , so ... - What ? Maurice told me that when he passed , you were the only one able to open it . No , he never gave me any combination . Maybe he did . I mean , maybe you just did n't know it was a combination . Well , what , then ? I do n't know , some meaningful combination of numbers ... based on your experiences with Maurice . We did n't have very many , uh , meaningful experiences together . Perhaps after your mother died . After my mother died , you know what he told me ? Robert , there 's really nothing to be said . Oh , well , he was bad with emotion . I was 11 , Uncle Peter . - How 's he doing ? - He 's in a lot of pain . When we get down to the lower levels , the pain will be less intense . And if he dies ? Worst-case scenario ? When he wakes up , his mind is completely gone . Cobb , I 'll still honor the arrangement . I appreciate that , Saito . But when you wake up , you wo n't even remember that we had an arrangement . Limbo is gonna become your reality . You 're gonna be lost down there so long that you 're gonna become an old man . Filled with regret ? Waiting to die alone . No . I 'll come back . And we 'll be young men together again . Breathe . These people are gonna kill us if we do n't give them the combination . - They just wanna ransom us . - I heard them . They 're gonna lock us in that van , and then drive it into the river . All right . What is in the safe ? Something for you . Maurice always said it was his most precious gift to you . - A will . - Maurice 's will is with Port and Dunn . That 's an alternate . This would supersede the other if you want it to . It splits up the component businesses of Fischer Morrow . It 'd be the end of the entire empire as we know it . Destroying my whole inheritance ? - Why would he suggest such a thing ? - I just do n't know . He loved you , Robert . In his own way . In his own way . At the end ... he called me in to his deathbed . He could barely speak . But he took the trouble to tell me one last thing . He pulled me close . And I could only make out ... one word . Disappointed . When were you in limbo ? You might have the rest of the team convinced to carry on with this job . - But they do n't know the truth . - Truth ? What truth ? The truth that , at any minute , you might bring a freight train through the wall . The truth that Mal is bursting through your subconscious . And the truth that , as we go deeper into Fischer ... we 're also going deeper into you . And I m not sure we 're gonna like what we find . We were working together . We were exploring the concept of a dream within a dream . I kept pushing things . I wanted to go deeper and deeper . I wanted to go further . I just did n't understand the concept that hours could turn into years down there ... that we could get trapped so deep ... that when we wound up on the shore of our own subconscious ... we lost sight of what was real . We created . We built the world for ourselves . We did that for years . We built our own world . How long were you stuck there ? Something like 50 years . Jesus . How could you stand it ? It was n't so bad at first , feeling like gods . The problem was knowing that none of it was real . Eventually , it just became impossible for me to live like that . And what about for her ? She had locked something away , something deep inside her . A truth that she had once known , but chose to forget . Limbo became her reality . What happened when you woke up ? Well , to wake up from that after years , after decades ... to become old souls thrown back into youth like that ? I knew something was wrong with her . She just would n't admit it . Eventually , she told me the truth . She was possessed by an idea . This one very simple idea that changed everything . That our world was n't real . That she needed to wake up to come back to reality ... that in order to get back home ... we had to kill ourselves . - What about your children ? - She thought they were projections ... that our real children were waiting for us up there somewhere . - I m their mother ! - Calm down . I can tell the difference . If this is my dream , why ca n't I control this ? You do n't know you 're dreaming ! She was certain there was nothing I could do ... no matter how much I begged , no matter how much I pleaded . She wanted to do it , but she could not do it alone . She loved me too much , so she came up with a plan on our anniversary . - Sweetheart , what are you doing ? - Join me . Just -- Just step back inside . All right ? Just step back inside now , come on . No . I 'm going to jump , and you 're coming with me . No , I 'm not . Now , you listen to me . If you jump , you 're not gonna wake up , remember ? You 're gonna die . Now , just step back inside . Come on . Step back inside so we can talk about this . We 've talked enough . - Mal . - Come out onto the ledge ... - ... or I ll jump right now . - Okay . We 're gonna talk about this . All right ? - I m asking you to take a leap of faith . - No , honey . No , I ca n't . You know I ca n't do that . Take a second , think about our children . Think about James . Think about Phillipa , now . If I go without you , they 'll take them away anyway . - What does that mean ? - I filed a letter with our attorney ... explaining how I 'm fearful for my safety . How you 've threatened to kill me . - Why did you do this ? - I love you , Dom . Why did -- ? Why would you do this to me ? I 've freed you from the guilt of choosing to leave them . We 're going home to our real children . Oh , no , no , no , Mal , you listen to me , all right ? Mal , look at me , please ? You 're waiting for a train . - Mal , goddamn it , do n't do this ! - A train that will take you far away . James and Phillipa are waiting for you ! You know where you hope this train will take you , but you ca n't know for sure . - Mal , look at me ! - But it does n't matter . - Mal , goddamn it ! Mal , listen to me ! - Because you 'll be together . Sweetheart ! Look at me ! Mal , no ! Jesus Christ ! She had herself declared sane by three different psychiatrists . It made it impossible for me to try to explain the nature of her madness . So I ran . Right now , or never , Cobb . James ! Phillipa ! Come on in ! Come on ! All right , let 's go . I left my children behind and I 've been trying to buy my way back ever since . Your guilt defines her . It 's what powers her . But you are not responsible for the idea that destroyed her . And if we are gonna succeed in this ... you have to forgive yourself , and you 're gonna have to confront her . But you do n't have to do that alone . - No , you 're not ... - I m doing it for the others . Because they have no idea the risk they 've taken coming down here with you . We have to move . Time 's up . All right . I do n't know any combination . - Not consciously , anyway . - How about instinctively , huh ? I got somebody in your father 's office right now ready to tap in the combination . Give me the first six numbers that come to your head right now . - I have no idea . - Right now ! I said , right now ! Right now ! Five , two , eight , four , nine , one . You 'll have to do better than that . All right . Bag them . You 're going for a ride . We 're worth more to you alive . You hear me ? What 'd you get ? Relationship with his father is worse than we imagined . This helps us how ? The stronger the issues , the more powerful the catharsis . - How are we gonna reconcile them ? - I m working on that . Work faster . The projections are closing in quick . We gotta break out of here before we 're totally boxed in . Damn it . You must n't be afraid to dream a little bigger , darling . We need to shift his animosity from his father to his godfather . - Destroy his one positive relationship ? - No , repair his relationship with his father ... whilst exposing his godfather 's true nature . We should charge Fischer a lot more than Saito for this job . His security is gonna get worse as we go deeper . - I think we run with Mr . Charles . - No . Who 's Mr . Charles ? - Bad idea . The second we get into that hotel his security 's gonna be all over us . We run with Mr . Charles like on the Stein job . - You 've done it before ? - Yeah , and it did n't work . The subject realized he was dreaming and his subconscious tore us to pieces . Excellent . But you learned a lot , right ? - I need some kind of distraction . - No problem . How about a lovely lady that I 've used before ? Listen to me . You drive carefully , all right ? Everything down there is gonna be unstable as hell . Do n't jump too soon . We only got one shot at that kick . We gotta make it . I 'll play the music to let you know it 's coming . The rest is on you . - You ready ? - Ready ! Sweet dreams . Am I boring you ? I was telling you my story . I guess it was n't to your liking . Um , I have a lot on my mind . There goes Mr . Charles . Mr . Fischer , right ? Pleasure to see you again . Rod Green from marketing . I -- Hmm . - And you must be ? - Leaving . In case you get bored . Must 've blown you off . That is , unless her phone number really is only six digits . Funny way to make friends , someone stealing your wallet like that . Goddamn it . The wallet alone is worth at least 500-- About 500 , right ? Do n't worry about it . My people are already on it as we speak . Who or what is Mr . Charles ? It 's a gambit designed to turn Fischer against his own subconscious . And why do n't you approve ? It involves telling the mark that he 's dreaming ... which involves attracting a lot of attention to us . - Did n't Cobb say never to do that ? - Hmm . So now you 've noticed how much time ... Cobb spends doing things he says never to do . Mr . Saito , can I have a moment ? - I m sorry , but ... - Hold on ! Wait ! You look a bit perkier . Very amusing , Mr . Eames . Turbulence on the plane ? No , it 's much closer . That 's Yusuf 's driving . Um , I 'm sorry . Who did you say you were ? Rod Green from marketing . But that 's not true at all , is it ? My name is Mr . Charles . You remember me , do n't you ? I 'm the head of your security down here . Get out on a different floor , keep moving . Dump the wallet . Security will be looking for that . - Okay . - We need to buy Cobb a little more time . Security , huh ? - You work for the hotel ? - No , no . I specialize in a very specific type of security . Subconscious security . You 're talking about dreams ? Are you talking about , um , extraction ? I am here to protect you . Mr . Fischer , I m here to protect you in the event ... that someone tries to access your mind through your dreams . You 're not safe here . They 're coming for you . Strange weather , is n't it ? You feel that ? What 's happening ? Cobb 's drawing Fischer 's attention to the strangeness of the dream ... which is making his subconscious look for the dreamer . For me . Quick , give me a kiss . - They 're still looking at us . - Yeah , it was worth a shot . We should probably get out of here . You feel that ? You 've actually been trained for this , Mr . Fischer . Pay attention to the strangeness of the weather , the shift in gravity . None of this is real . You 're in a dream . Now , the easiest way for you to test yourself ... is to try and remember how you arrived at this hotel . Can you do that ? Yeah , I ... No , breathe , breathe . Remember your training . Accept the fact that you 're in a dream , and I m here to protect you . Go on . Mm-hm . - You 're not real ? - No . No . I 'm a projection of your subconscious . I was sent here to protect you in the event ... that extractors tried to pull you into a dream . And I believe that 's what 's going on right now , Mr . Fischer . Yeah . Okay . Okay . Can you get me out of here ? Right away . Follow me . Hold on a second . Jesus Christ ! What are you doing ? These men were sent here to abduct you , all right ? If you want my help , you have to remain calm . I need you to work with me , Mr . Fischer . If this is a dream , I should just kill myself to wake up , right ? I would n't do that if I were you , Mr . Fischer . I believe they have you sedated , and if you pull that trigger ... you may not wake up . You may go into a further dream state . Now , you know what I 'm talking about . You remember the training . Remember what I said to you . Give me the gun . - This room should be directly below 528 ? - Yeah . Think , Mr . Fischer , think . What do you remember from before this dream ? There was , um , a lot of gunfire . There was rain . Uncle Peter . - Oh , my God , we 've been kidnapped . - Where were they holding you ? - They had us in the back of a van . - That explains the gravity shifts . You 're in the back of a van . Keep going . It had something to do with , um ... Something to do with a safe . God , why is it so hard to remember ? It 's like trying to remember a dream after you 've woken up . Listen , it takes years of practice . You and Browning have been pulled into this dream ... because they 're trying to steal something from your mind . I need you to focus and try and remember what that is . What is it , Mr . Fischer ? Think ! A combination . They demanded the first numbers to pop into my head . They 're trying to extract a number from your subconscious . It can represent anything . We 're in a hotel right now . We should try hotel rooms . What was the number , Mr . Fischer ? Try and remember for me . This is very important . Five . Five , two-- It was something , it was a long number . That 's good . We can start there . Fifth floor . Yep . - So do you use a timer ? - No , I have to judge it for myself . While you 're all asleep in 528 , I wait for Yusuf 's kick . - Well , how will you know ? - His music warns me . And then when the van hits the barrier of the bridge , that should be unmistakable . So we get a nice synchronized kick . If it 's too soon , we wo n't get pulled out . But if it 's too late , I wo n't be able to drop us . - Well , why not ? - Because the van will be in freefall . - Ca n't drop you without gravity . - Right . They 're with me . Go on . Mr . Charles . - Do you know what that is , Mr . Fischer ? - Yeah , I think so . They were trying to put you under . - I m already under . - Under again . What do you mean , a dream within a dream ? Hey . I see you 've changed . I 'm sorry ? Oh , I m sorry . I mistook you for a friend . Oh . Good-looking fellow , I m sure . No , no , no . That 's Fischer 's projection of Browning . Let 's follow him and see how he behaves . - Why ? - Because how he acts will tell us ... if Fischer is starting to suspect his motives the way we want him to . Shh . - Uncle Peter . - You said you were kidnapped together ? Well , not exactly . They already had him . They were torturing him . And you saw them torture him ? The kidnappers are working for you ? Robert . You 're trying to get that safe open ? To get the alternate will ? Fischer Morrow has been my entire life . I ca n't let you destroy it . I 'm not gonna throw away my inheritance . I could n't let you rise to your father 's last taunt . - What taunt ? - The will , Robert . That will ? That 's his last insult . A challenge for you to build something for yourself ... by telling you you 're not worthy of his accomplishments . - What , but that he was , um , disappointed ? - I m sorry . But he 's wrong . You can build a better company than he ever did . Mr . Fischer ? He 's lying . - How do you know ? - Trust me , it 's what I do . He 's hiding something , and we need to find out what that is . I need you to do the same thing to him that he was going to do to you . We 'll enter his subconscious and find out what he does n't want you to know . All right . He 's out . - Wait . Whose subconscious are we going into exactly ? We 're going into Fischer 's . I told him it was Browning 's so he 'd be a part of our team . He 's gonna help us break into his own subconscious . That 's right . Security 's gonna run you down hard . And I will lead them on a merry chase . - Just be back before the kick . - Go to sleep , Mr . Eames . You good ? Hey . You ready ? Yes , yes . I m fine . I m ready . Cobb ? Cobb ? What 's down there ? Hopefully , the truth we want Fischer to learn . I mean , what 's down there for you ? Did you see that ? Eames , this is your dream . I need you to draw the security away from the complex , understand ? - Who guides Fischer in ? - Not me . If I know the route , everything could be compromised . - I designed the place . - No , you 're with me . I could do it . All right . Brief him on the route into the complex . - Fischer , you 'll be going with him . - All right . What about you ? You keep this live . I 'll be listening in the whole time . The windows on that upper floor are big enough for me to cover you from that tower . You 're not coming in ? In order to find out the truth about your father ... you 're gonna need to break into Browning 's mind on your own . Come on , Fischer ! - Sound the alarm ! Sound the alarm ! - Go , go , go ! Move ! Go ! Sod it . I hope you 're ready . No , it 's too soon . Cobb , do you hear that ? I first noticed it about 20 minutes ago , I thought it was the wind up here . Yeah , I hear it . It s music . So , what do we do ? We move fast . Yusuf 's 10 seconds from the jump . Which gives Arthur three minutes . - Hey ! - That 's him ! - Which gives us what ? - Sixty minutes . - Can they make that route in an hour ? - They have to climb to the terrace . Then they need a new route , a more direct route . It 's designed as a labyrinth . There must be access routes that cut through the maze . Eames ? Did Eames add any features ? I do n't think I should tell you . We do n't have time for this . Did he add anything ? He added an air-duct system ... - ... that can cut through the maze . - Good . Explain it to them . Paradox . What was that ? - The kick . Cobb ! Cobb , did we miss it ? Yeah , we missed it . Man . Could n't someone have dreamt up a goddamn beach ? Huh ? Uh-huh . Well , what the hell do we do now ? We finish the job before the next kick . - What next kick ? - When the van hits the water . If you d like to make a call , please hang up and try again . If you need help , hang up ... How do I drop you without gravity ? Arthur has a couple minutes , and we have about 20 . You okay ? Run ! Turn around ! Move to base ! Move to base ! Go , go , go ! There 's something wrong . They 're heading your way , like they know something . Just buy us more time , all right ? - Come on ! - On my way . Come on ! Move ! All right . Okay . That 's the antechamber outside the strong room . - Does the strong room have windows ? - It would n't be very strong if it did . Let 's hope Fischer likes what he finds in there . - Are those projections his subconscious ? - Yes . - Are you destroying parts of his mind ? - No . They 're just projections . - We 're here . - You 're clear , but hurry . There 's an entire army headed your way . I 'm in . There he is . - There 's someone in there . - Fischer , it 's a trap . Get out . Come on . Come on , a little lower . Cobb . No , she is not real . How do you know that ? She is just a projection . Fischer . Fischer is real . Hello . Eames ! Eames , get to the antechamber now ! What happened ? - Mal killed Fischer . I could n't shoot her . There 's no use in reviving him . His mind 's already trapped down there . It 's all over . So that 's it , then ? We failed ? We 're done . I 'm sorry . It 's not me that does n't get back to my family , is it ? Shame . I wanted to know what was gonna happen in there . I swear we had this . Let 's set the charges . No , there 's still another way . - We have to follow Fischer down there . - Not enough time . No , but there will be enough time down there . And we will find him . Okay , as soon as Arthur 's music kicks in , just use the defibrillator to revive him . We can give him his own kick down below . Look , you get him in there . As soon as the music ends , you blow up the hospital ... and we all ride the kick back up the layers . It 's worth a shot , if Saito can hold the guards off while I set the charges . Saito will never make it , will he ? - Cobb , come on . We 've gotta try this . - Go for it . If you are not back before the kick , I am gone with or without you . She 's right . She 's right . Come on . Let 's go . Can I trust you to do what needs to happen here ? Mal 's gonna be down there . I know where to find her . She 'll have Fischer . - How do you know ? - Because she wants me to come after him . She wants me back down there with her . All right ? - This is your world ? - It was . And this is where she 'll be . Come on . Saito . Saito . I need you to take care of Fischer while I go set some charges , okay ? No room for tourists on these jobs . Do n't be silly . You built all this ? This is incredible . We built for years . Then we started in on the memories . This way . This was our neighborhood . Places from our past . That was our first apartment . Then we moved to that building right there . After Mal became pregnant , that became our home . You reconstructed all of this from memory ? Like I told you , we had lots of time . What is that ? That 's the house Mal grew up in . - Well , will she be in there ? - No . Come on . We both wanted to live in a house , but we loved this type of building . In the real world , we 'd have to choose , but not here . How are we gonna bring Fischer back ? We 're gonna have to come up with some kind of a kick . What ? I 'm gonna improvise . Listen , there 's something you should know about me . About inception . An idea is like a virus . Resilient . Highly contagious . And the smallest seed of an idea can grow . It can grow to define ... or destroy you . The smallest idea , such as : Your world is not real . Simple little thought that changes everything . So certain of your world . Of what 's real . Do you think he is ? Or do you think he 's as lost as I was ? I know what 's real , Mal . No creeping doubts ? Not feeling persecuted , Dom ? Chased around the globe ... by anonymous corporations and police forces ... the way the projections persecute the dreamer ? Admit it . You do n't believe in one reality anymore . So choose . Choose to be here . Choose me . You know what I have to do . I have to get back to our children because you left them . Because you left us . - You 're wrong . - I m not wrong . You 're confused . Our children are here . And you 'd like to see their faces again , would n't you ? Yes , but I m gonna see them up above , Mal . Up above ? Listen to yourself . These are our children . Watch . James ? Phillipa ? Do n't do this , Mal . Please . Those are n't my children . You keep telling yourself that , but you do n't believe it . - No , I know it . - What if you 're wrong ? What if I 'm what 's real ? You keep telling yourself what you know . But what do you believe ? What do you feel ? Guilt . I feel guilt , Mal . And no matter what I do , no matter how hopeless I am ... no matter how confused , that guilt is always there ... reminding me of the truth . What truth ? That the idea that caused you to question your reality came from me . You planted the idea in my mind ? What is she talking about ? The reason I knew inception was possible was because I did it to her first . - I did it to my own wife . - Why ? We were lost in here . I knew we needed to escape , but she would n't accept it . She had locked something away , something deep inside . A truth that she had once known , but chose to forget . And she could n't break free . So I decided to search for it . I went deep into the recess of her mind and found that secret place . And I broke in ... and I planted an idea . A simple little idea that would change everything . That her world was n't real . That death was the only escape . You 're waiting for a train . A train that 'll take you far away . You know where you hope this train will take you ... but you ca n't know for sure . Yet it does n't matter . - Now , tell me why ! - Because you 'll be together ! But I never knew that that idea would grow in her mind like a cancer ... that even after she woke ... That even after you came back to reality ... that you 'd continue to believe your world was n't real . That death was the only escape . Mal , no ! Jesus ! - You infected my mind . - I was trying to save you . You betrayed me . But you can make amends . You can still keep your promise . We can still be together , right here ... in the world we built together . Cobb , we need to get Fischer . You ca n't have him . - lf I stay here , will you let him go ? - What are you talking about ? Fischer is on the porch . - Go check he 's alive , Ariadne . - Cobb , you ca n't do this . Go check he 's alive right now . Do it . He 's here ! And it 's time , but you have to come now ! You take Fischer with you , all right ? - You ca n't stay here to be with her . I 'm not . Saito 's dead by now . That means he 's down here somewhere . That means I have to find him . I ca n't stay with her anymore , because she does n't exist . I 'm the only thing you do believe in anymore . No . I wish . I wish more than anything , but ... I ca n't imagine you with all your complexity ... all your perfection , all your imperfection . - You all right ? - Yeah . Look at you . You 're just a shade . You 're just a shade of my real wife . And you were the best that I could do , but ... I m sorry , you 're just not good enough . Does this feel real ? - What are you doing ? - Improvising . No , no , no ! In there , now . Go , go , go . I was dis -- I was dis Disa -- - I know , Dad . - Dis -- I know you were disappointed ... I could n't be you . No . No , no , no . I was disappointed ... that you tried . What ? Come on , come on . Dad ? That 's the kick , Ariadne ! You have to go now ! Do n't lose yourself ! Find Saito and bring him back ! I will ! You remember when you asked me to marry you ? Yes . You said you dreamt that we 'd grow old together . But we did . We did . You do n't remember ? I miss you more than I can bear ... but we had our time together . And I have to let you go . I have to let you go . I 'm sorry , Robert . You know , the will means that Dad wanted me to be my own man ... not just to live for him . That 's what I m gonna do , Uncle Peter . What happened ? - Cobb stayed . - With Mal ? No , to find Saito . He 'll be lost . No , he 'll be all right . Have you come to kill me ? I 'm waiting for someone . Someone from a half-remembered dream . Cobb ? Impossible . We were young men together . I 'm an old man . Filled with regret . Waiting to die alone . I 've come back for you . To remind you of something . Something you once knew . That this world is not real . To convince me to honor our arrangement ? To take a leap of faith , yes . Come back ... so we can be young men together again . Come back with me . Come back . Hot towel , sir ? We 'll be landing in Los Angeles in about 20 minutes . Do you need immigration forms ? Thank you . Hot towel , sir ? - No . - Do you need immigration forms ? Welcome home , Mr . Cobb . Thank you , sir . Welcome . This way . James ? Phillipa ? Look who 's here . Hey . - Hey , guys ! Hey ! How are you ? - Daddy ! Daddy ! - Daddy ! - How are you ? Look what I ve been building ! - What are you building ? - We 're building a house on the cliff ! On the cliff ? Come on , I want you to show me . Can you show me ? - Let 's go . - Come on , Daddy ! Born of cold and winter air And mountain rain combining This icy force both foul and fair Has a frozen heart worth mining So out through the heart Cold and clear Strike for love and strike for fear See the beauty sharp and sheer Split the ice apart And break the frozen heart Hup , ho Watch your step Let it go Hup , ho Watch your step Let it go Beautiful Powerful Dangerous Cold Ice has a magic Ca n't be controlled Stronger than one Stronger than ten Stronger than a hundred men !

It 's my daughter . It 's the king . Trolls ? Shush ! I 'm trying to listen . Cuties . I 'm going to keep you . Your Majesty . Born with the powers , or cursed ? Born . And they 're getting stronger . Here , here . You are lucky it was n't her heart . The heart is not so easily changed . But the head can be persuaded . Do what you must . I recommend we remove all magic . Even memories of magic , to be safe . But do n't worry . I 'll leave the fun . She will be okay . But she wo n't remember I have powers ? It 's for the best . Listen to me , Elsa . Your power will only grow . There is beauty in it ... But also great danger . You must learn to control it . Fear will be your enemy . No ! We 'll protect her . She can learn to control it . I 'm sure . Until then ... We 'll look the gates . We 'll reduce the staff . We will limit her contact with people , and keep her powers hidden from everyone . Including Anna . Ah . Elsa ? Do you wanna build a snowman ? Come on , let 's go and play I never see you anymore Come out the door It 's like you 've gone away We used to be best buddies And now we 're not I wish you would tell me why Do you wanna build a snowman ?

Twelve older brothers . Three of them pretended I was invisible , literally , for two years . That 's horrible . It 's what brothers do . And sisters . Elsa and I were really close when we were little . But then , one day , she just shut me out , and I never knew why . I would never shut you out . Okay , can I just say something crazy ? I love crazy . All my life has been A series of doors in my face And then suddenly I bump into you I was thinking the same thing , because , like ...

I 'm sorry , I 'm confused . Well , we have n't worked out all the details ourselves . We 'll need a few days to plan the ceremony . Of course , we 'll have soup , roast and ice cream . And then ... Wait . Would we live here ? Here ? Absolutely ! Anna ! Oh ! We can invite all 12 of your brothers to stay with us . What ? No , no , no . Of course we have the room . Wait , slow down . No one 's brothers are staying here . No one is getting married . Wait , what ? May I talk to you , please ? Alone . No . Whatever you have to say , you can say to both of us . Fine . You ca n't marry a man you just met . You can if it 's true love . Anna , what do you know about true love ? More than you . All you know is how to shut people out . You asked for my blessing , but my answer is no . Now , excuse me . Your Majesty , if I may ease your ... No , you may not . And I think you should go . The party is over . Close the gates . Yes , Your Majesty . What ? Elsa , no , no ! Wait . Give me my glove ! Elsa , please , please . I ca n't live like this anymore ! Then leave . What did I ever do to you ? Enough , Anna . No , why ? Why do you shut me out ? Why do you shut the world out ? What are you so afraid of ? I said , enough ! Sorcery . I knew there was something dubious going on here . Elsa . There she is ! Yes ! It is her ! Queen Elsa . Our beautiful queen ! Your Majesty ? Are you all right ? No . There she is ! Stop her ! Please , just stay away from me . Stay away . Monster . Monster ! Elsa ! Elsa ! Wait , please ! Elsa , stop ! Anna ! No . The fjord . Snow ! Snow ? Yes , snow . Are you all right ? No . Did you know ? No . Look , it 's snowing . It 's snowing ! The queen has cursed this land ! She must be stopped ! You have to go after her . Wait , no ! You ! Is there sorcery in you , too ? Are you a monster , too ? No , no . I 'm completely ordinary . That 's right , she is . In the best way . And my sister is not a monster . She nearly killed me ! You slipped on ice . Her ice . It was an accident . She was scared . She did n't mean it . She did n't mean any of this . Tonight was my fault . I pushed her . So , I 'm the one that needs to go after her . What ? Bring me my horse , please . Anna , no . It 's too dangerous . Elsa is not dangerous . I 'll bring her back , and I 'll make this right . I 'm coming with you . No , I need you here to take care of Arendelle . On my honor . I leave Prince Hans in charge . Are you sure you can trust her ? I do n't want you getting hurt . She 's my sister . She would never hurt me . The snow glows white On the mountain tonight Not a footprint to be seen A kingdom of isolation And it looks like I 'm the queen The wind is howling Like this swirling storm inside Could n't keep it in Heaven knows I tried Do n't let them in Do n't let them see Be the good girl You always have to be Conceal , do n't feel Do n't let them know Well , now they know Let it go ! Let it go ! Ca n't hold me back anymore Let it go ! Let it go ! Turn away and slam the door I do n't care What they 're going to say Let the storm rage on The cold never bothered me anyway It 's funny how some distance Makes everything seem small And the fears that once controlled me Ca n't get to me at all It 's time to see what I can do To test the limits and break through No right , no wrong No rules for me I 'm free ! Let it go ! Let it go ! I am one with the wind and sky Let it go ! Let it go ! You 'll never see me cry Here I stand And here I 'll stay Let the storm rage on My power flurries through the air Into the ground My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals All around And one thought crystallizes Like an icy blast I 'm never going back The past is in the past Let it go ! Let it go ! And I 'll rise like the break of dawn Let it go ! Let it go ! That perfect girl is gone Here I stand In the light of day Let the storm rage on ! The cold never bothered me anyway Elsa ! Elsa ! Elsa , it 's me , Anna , your sister who did n't mean to make you freeze the summer . I 'm sorry . It 's all my fault . Of course , none of it would have happened if she had just told me her secret . She 's a stinker . Whoa ! Oh , no . No , no , no ! Come back ! No , no , no ! Okay . Snow . It had to be snow . She could n't have had tropical magic that covered the fjords in white sand and warm ... Fire ! Cold , cold , cold , cold , cold . Ooh . And sauna ! Yoo-hoo . Hmm ? Big summer blowout . Half off swimming suits , clogs , and a sun balm of my own invention , yah ? Oh . Great . For now , um , how about boots ? Winter boots and dresses ? That would be in our winter department . Oh . Um ... I was just wondering . Has another young woman ... The queen perhaps , I do n't know , passed through here ? The only one crazy enough to be out in this storm is you , dear . You and this fellow . Yoo-hoo . Big summer blowout . Carrots . Huh ? Behind you . Oh ! Right . Excuse me . Oh . A real howler in July , yes ? Wherever could it be coming from ? The North Mountain . North Mountain . That Will be 40 . Forty ? No , 10 . Oh , dear , that 's no good . See , this is from our winter stock , where supply and demand have a big problem . You want to talk about a supply and demand problem ? I sell ice for a living . Ooh . That 's a rough business to be in right now . I mean , that is really ... That 's unfortunate . Still 40 . But I will throw in a visit to Oaken 's sauna . Yoo-hoo . Hi , family . Yoo-hoo ! Ten is all I got . Help me out . Okay . Ten will get you this and no more . Okay , just tell me one thing . What was happening on the North Mountain ? Did it seem magical ? Yes ! Now , back up while I deal with this crook , here . What did you call me ? Okay , okay . I 'm out . Whoa ! Bye-bye . No , Sven , I did n't get your carrots . But I did find us a place to sleep . And it 's free . I 'm sorry about this violence . I will add a quart of lutefisk , so we have good feelings . Just the outfit and the boots , yah ? Uh ... Reindeers are better than people Sven , do n't you think that 's true ? Yeah , people will beat you And curse you and cheat you Every one of them 's bad , except you Aw . Thanks , buddy . But people smell better than reindeers Sven , do n't you think I 'm right ? That 's once again true For all , except you You got me Let 's call it a night Good night Do n't let the frostbite Bite Nice duet . It 's just you . What do you want ? I want you to take me up the North Mountain . I do n't take people places . Let me rephrase that . Hey . Take me up the North Mountain . Please . Look , I know how to stop this winter . We leave at dawn . And you forgot the carrots for Sven . Oops , sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I did n't ... We leave now . Right now . Whew ! Hang on ! We like to go fast . I like fast . Whoa ! Whoa , whoa , whoa ... Get your feet down . This is fresh lacquer . Seriously , were you raised in a barn ? Ugh ! No , I was raised in a castle . Hmm . So , uh , tell me , what made the queen go all ice-crazy ? Oh . Well ... It was all my fault . I got engaged , but then she freaked out , because I 'd only just met him , you know , that day . And she said she would n't bless the marriage , and ... Wait . You got engaged to someone you just met that day ? Yeah . Anyway , I got mad , and so she got mad , and then she tried to walk away , and I grabbed her glove ... Hang on ! You mean to tell me you got engaged to someone you just met that day ? Yes . Pay attention . But the thing is , she wore the gloves all the time , so I just thought , maybe she has a thing about dirt . Did n't your parents ever warn you about strangers ? Yes , they did . But Hans is not a stranger . Oh , yeah ? What 's his last name ? Of the Southern Isles . What 's his favorite food ? Sandwiches . Best friend 's name ? Probably John . Eye color ? Dreamy . Foot size ? Foot size does n't matter . Have you had a meal with him yet ? What if you hate the way he eats ? What if you hate the way he picks his nose ? Picks his nose ? And eats it . Excuse me , sir . He is a prince . All men do it . Ew . Look , it does n't matter . It 's true love . It does n't sound like true love . Are you some sort of love expert ? No . But , uh , I have friends who are . You have friends who are love experts ? I 'm not buying it . Stop talking . No , no , no . No , no . I 'd like to meet these ... No , I mean it . Sven , go . Go ! What are they ? Wolves . Wolves ? What do we do ? I got this . You just ... Do n't fall off , and do n't get eaten . But I want to help ! No . Why not ? Because I do n't trust your judgment . Excuse me ? Who marries a man she just met ? It 's true love ! Whoa ! Whoa . Whoa ! Christopher ! It 's Kristoff ! Ow ! Duck ! You almost set me on fire ! But I did n't . Get ready to jump , Sven ! You do n't tell him what to do . Hey ! I do ! Jump , Sven ! Phew ! But I just paid it off . Uh-oh . No . No . No ! Ah ! No , no , no , no , no , no , no ! Grab on ! Pull , Sven . Pull ! Whoa . I 'll replace your sled , and everything in it . And I understand if you do n't want to help me anymore . Of course I do n't want to help her anymore . In fact , this whole thing has ruined me for helping anyone ever again . It 's this way ? She 'll die on her own . I can live with that . Here we go . But you wo n't get your new sled if she 's dead . I think , actually , it 's up . Sometimes , I really do n't like you . Hold up ! We 're coming . You are ? I mean , sure . I 'll let you tag along . Arendelle . It 's completely frozen . But it will be fine . Elsa will thaw it . Will she ? Yeah . Now , come on . This way to the North Mountain ? More like this way . I never knew winter could be so beautiful . Yeah . It really is beautiful , is n't it ? But it 's so white . You know , how about a little color ? I 'm thinking maybe some crimson , chartreuse . How about yellow ? No , not yellow . Yellow and snow ? No go . Am I right ? Hi . You 're creepy . Whoa ! I do n't want it . Back at you . Please do n't drop me . No . Come on , it 's just a head . All right . We got off to a bad start . Ew , ew , ew , the body ! Wait , what am I looking at right now ? Why are you hanging off the earth like a bat ? All right , wait one second . Oh . Uh ... Oh ! Thank you . You 're welcome . Now , I 'm perfect . Well , almost . It was like my whole life got turned upside down . Oh ! Too hard . I 'm sorry ! Head rush ! I was just ... Are you okay ? Are you kidding me ? I am wonderful ! I 've always wanted a nose . So cute . It 's like a little baby unicorn . But ... Hey ! Whoa ! Oh . I love it even more . All right , let 's start this thing over . Hi , everyone . I 'm Olaf . And I like warm hugs . Olaf ? That 's right . Olaf . And you are ? Oh . Um ... I 'm Anna . And who 's the funky-looking donkey over there ? That 's Sven . Uh-huh . And who 's the reindeer ? Sven . Oh , the ... Oh . Okay . That makes things easier for me . Aw , look at him trying to kiss my nose . I like you , too . Olaf . Did Elsa build you ? Yeah . Why ? Do you know where she is ? Fascinating . Yeah . Why ? Do you think you could show us the way ? Yeah . Why ? How does this work ? Ow ! Stop it , Sven . I 'm trying to focus , here . Yeah . Why ? I 'll tell you why . We need Elsa to bring back summer . Summer ? Mmm-hmm . Oh . I do n't know why , but I 've always loved the idea of summer . And sun , and all things hot . Really ? I 'm guessing you do n't have much experience with heat . Nope . But sometimes I like to close my eyes , and imagine what it would be like when summer does come . Bees will buzz Kids will blow dandelion fuzz And I 'll be doing Whatever snow does in summer A drink in my hand My snow up against the burning sand Probably getting gorgeously tanned In summer I 'll finally see a summer breeze Blow away a winter storm And find out what happens to solid water When it gets warm And I ca n't wait to see What my buddies all think of me Just imagine how much cooler I 'll be In summer ! The hot and the cold are both so intense Put them together It just makes sense Winter 's a good time To stay in and cuddle But put me in summer and I 'll be a ... Happy snowman ! When life gets rough I like to hold on to my dream Relaxing in the summer sun Just letting off steam Oh , the sky Will be blue And you guys will be there , too When I finally do What frozen things do In summer ! I 'm gonna tell him . Do n't you dare . In summer ! So , come on ! Elsa 's this way . Let 's go bring back summer ! I 'm coming ! Somebody 's gotta tell him . No , no . You 've got the bark facing down . The bark needs to be face-up . Bark down is drier . Bark up ! Bark down ! Papa ! Cloak ? Does anyone need a cloak ? Arendelle is indebted to you , Your Highness . The castle is open . There is soup and hot glogg in the great hall . Here , pass these out . Prince Hans ! Are we expected to just sit here and freeze while you give away all of Arendelle 's tradable goods ? Princess Anna has given her orders . And that 's another thing ! Has it dawned on you that your princess may be conspiring with a wicked Sorceress to destroy us all ? Do not question the princess . She left me in charge and I will not hesitate to protect Arendelle from treason . Treason ? Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa , boy . Easy . Easy . It 's Princess Anna 's horse . So , where is the princess ? Where could she be ? Where is she ? Princess Anna is in trouble . I need volunteers to go with me to find her . I 'll go . I volunteer . I volunteer two men , My Lord . Be prepared for anything . And should you encounter the queen , you are to put an end to this winter . Do you understand ? Hmm . So , how exactly are you planning to stop this weather ? Oh . I am gonna talk to my sister . That 's your plan ? My ice business is riding on you talking to your sister ? Yep . So , you 're not at all afraid of her ? Why would I be ? Yeah . I bet she 's the nicest , gentlest , warmest person ever . Oh . Look at that . I 've been impaled . What now ? Mmm ... It 's too steep . I 've only got one rope and you do n't know how to climb mountains . Says who ? Hmm ? What are you doing ? I 'm going to see my sister . You 're gonna kill yourself . I would n't put my foot there . You 're distracting me . Or there . How do you know Elsa even wants to see you ? All right . I 'm just blocking you out because I gotta concentrate , here . You know , most people who disappear into the mountains want to be alone . Nobody wants to be alone . Except maybe you . I 'm not alone . I have friends , remember ? You mean , the love experts ? Yes , the love experts . Ah ... Please tell me I 'm almost there . Does the air seem a bit thin to you up here ? Hang on . Hey , Sven ? Not sure if this is gonna solve the problem , but I found a staircase that leads exactly where you wanted to go . Ha-ha ! Thank goodness . Catch ! Thanks . That was like a crazy trust exercise . Whoa . Now , that 's ice . I might cry . Go ahead . I wo n't judge . All right , take it easy , boy . Come here . I got you . Okay . You stay right here , buddy . Flawless . Knock . Just knock . Why is n't she knocking ? Do you think she knows how to knock ? Huh . It opened . That 's a first . Oh . You should probably wait out here . What ? The last time I introduced her to a guy , she froze everything . But , but ... Oh , come on ! It 's a palace made of ice . Ice is my life ! Bye , Sven . You , too , Olaf . Me ? Just give us a minute . Okay . One , two , three ... Four ... Whoa . Elsa ? It 's me , Anna . Anna . Whoa . Elsa , you look different . It 's a good different . And this place ... It 's amazing . Thank you . I never knew what I was capable of . I 'm so sorry about what happened . If I 'd have known ... No , no , no . It 's okay . You do n't have to apologize , but you should probably go . Please . But I just got here . You belong down in Arendelle . So do you . No , Anna , I belong here . Alone . Where I can be who I am without hurting anybody . Actually , about that ... Sixty ! Wait . What is that ? Hi ! I 'm Olaf and I like warm hugs ! Olaf ? Yeah . You built me . Remember that ? And you 're alive ? Um ... I think so . He 's just like the one we built as kids . Yeah . Elsa , we were so close . We can be like that again . Catch me ! Slow down ! Anna ! No . We ca n't . Goodbye , Anna . Elsa , wait . No , I 'm just trying to protect you . You do n't have to protect me . I 'm not afraid . Please do n't shut me out again . Please do n't slam the door You do n't have to keep Your distance anymore 'Cause for the first time in forever I finally understand For the first time in forever We can fix this hand in hand We can head down this mountain together . You do n't have to live in fear 'Cause for the first time in forever I Will be right here Anna . Please go back home Your life awaits Go enjoy the sun And open up the gates Yeah , but ... I know . You mean well But leave me be Yes , I 'm alone But I 'm alone and free Just stay away And you 'll be safe from me Actually , we 're not What do you mean , you 're not ? I get the feeling you do n't know What do I not know ? Arendelle 's in deep , deep , deep Deep snow What ? You kind of set off an eternal winter everywhere . Everywhere ? Well , it 's okay , you can just unfreeze it . No , I ca n't . I do n't know how . Sure you can . I know you can . 'Cause for the first time in forever Oh , I 'm such a fool ! I ca n't be free !

We can face this thing together No ! We can change this winter weather And everything will be all right I ca n't ! Anna ! Are you okay ? I 'm okay . I 'm fine . Who 's this ? Wait , it does n't matter . Just ... You have to go . No , I know we can figure this out together . How ? What power do you have to stop this winter ? To stop me ? Anna , I think we should go . No , I 'm not leaving without you , Elsa . Yes , you are . Stop ! Put us down ! Go away . Heads up ! Watch out for my butt ! It is not nice to throw people ! Whoa , whoa , whoa , feisty-pants . Okay , relax . Just calm down ! Calm down ! Okay ! All right ! I 'm okay . Just let the snowman be . I 'm calm . Great . Oh ! Come on ! Oh . Look , see ? Now , you made him mad . I 'll distract him .

What 's that for ? I 'm digging a snow anchor . Okay . What if we fall ? There 's 20 feet of fresh powder down there . It 'll be like landing on a pillow . Hopefully . Okay , Anna . On three . Okay . One ... You tell me when . I 'm ready to go . Two ... I was born ready ! Yes ! Calm down . Tree ! What the ... Whoa ! That happened . Man , am I out of shape . There we go . Hey , Anna ! Sven !

And then there 's your ice business . Hey , hey . Do n't worry about my ice business . Worry about your hair ! What ? I just fell off a cliff . You should see your hair . No , yours is turning white . White ? It 's ... What ? It 's because she struck you , is n't it ? Does it look bad ? No . You hesitated . No , I did n't . Anna , you need help , okay ? Come on . Okay ! Where are we going ? To see my friends . The love experts ? Love experts ? Uh-huh . And do n't worry , they 'll be able to fix this . How do you know ? Because I 've seen them do it before . I like to consider myself a love expert . Get it together . Control it . Do n't feel . Do n't feel . Do n't feel . Do n't feel ! Look , Sven , the sky is awake . Are you cold ? A little . Uh ... Wait . Come here . Huh ? Ooh . So , uh , about my friends . Well ... I say friends ... They 're more like family . Anyway , when I was a kid , it was just me and Sven . Until they , you know , kinda took us in . They did ? Yeah . I do n't want to scare you . They can be a little inappropriate and loud . Very loud . They are also stubborn at times , and a little overbearing . And heavy . Really , really , heavy . But you 'll get it . They mean well . Kristoff , they sound wonderful . Okay , then . Meet my family . Hey , guys . They 're rocks . You are a sight for sore eyes . He 's crazy . Rocko 's looking sharp , as usual . Clay , whoa ... I do n't even recognize you .

Why are n't you running ? Uh ... Okay . Well , I 'm gonna go . Go . No , no , no . Anna , wait . Kristoff ! Whoa ! Hey ! Kristoff 's home ! Kristoff 's here ! Kristoff 's home ! Wait , Kristoff ? Uh-huh . Ah , let me look at you . Take off your clothes , I wash them . No ! No , I 'm going to keep my clothes on . Look , it 's great to see you all , but where 's Granpabbie ? He 's napping . But look , I grew a mushroom . I ... I earned my fire crystal . I passed a kidney stone . Kristoff , pick me up . You 're getting big . Good for you . Trolls . They 're trolls ! He 's brought a girl ! A girl ! Whoa ! Is that a real girl ? She 's like a little cupcake . What 's going on ? I 've learned to just roll with it . Let me see . Bright eyes , working nose , strong teeth ! Yes , yes . She 'll do nicely for our Kristoff . Wait , wait , wait . Oh , um , no . No . You 've got the wrong idea . No . That 's not why I brought her here . Right . We 're not ... I 'm not ... What 's the issue , dear ? Why are you holding back from such a man ? Is it the clumpy way he walks ? What ? Or the grumpy way he talks ? Oh , no . Or the pear-shaped , square-shaped Weirdness of his feet ? Hey ! And though we know he washes well He always ends up sort of smelly But you 'll never meet a fella Who 's as sensitive and sweet That 's nice , but ... So , he 's a bit of a fixer-upper Whoa , whoa , whoa ... So , he 's got a few flaws Like his peculiar brain , dear His thing with the reindeer That 's a little outside of nature 's laws This is not about me ! So , he 's a bit of a fixer-upper But this we 're certain of You can fix this fixer-upper up With a little bit of love - Um ... Can we please just stop talking about this ? We 've got a real , actual problem , here . I 'll say . So , tell me , dear ... Is it the way that he runs scared ? Or that he 's socially impaired ? Or that he only likes To tinkle in the woods ? I did not need to know that . Are you holding back your fondness Due to his unmanly blondness ? Or the way he covers up That he 's the honest goods ? He 's just a bit of a fixer-upper He 's got a couple of bugs No , I do n't ! His isolation is confirmation Of his desperation for healing hugs - Aw . So , he 's a bit of a fixer-upper But we know what to do The way to fix up this fixer-upper Is to fix him up with you Whoa ! Stop it , stop it , stop it ! Enough ! She is engaged to someone else , okay ? So , she 's a bit of a fixer-upper That 's a minor thing Her quote engagement Is a flex arrangement And by the way , I do n't see no ring So , she 's a bit of a fixer-upper Hey ! Whoa , watch it ! Her brain 's a bit betwixt Get the fianc out of the way And the whole thing will be fixed We 're not saying you can change him 'Cause people do n't really change We 're only saying that love 's a force That 's powerful and strange People make bad choices If they 're mad or scared or stressed But throw a little love their way Throw a little love their way And you 'll bring out their best True love brings out the best Everyone 's a bit of a fixer-upper That 's what it 's all about Father ! Sister ! Brother ! We need each other to raise us up And round us out Everyone 's a bit of a fixer-upper But when push comes to shove The only fixer-upper fixer That can fix a fixer-upper is ... True , true True Love ! Love , love , love Love True love True Do you , Anna , take Kristoff to be your trollfully wedded ... Wait , what ? You 're getting married . Love ! Anna ? She 's as cold as ice . There is strange magic here . Granpabbie . Come , come . Bring her here to me . Anna , your life is in danger . There is ice in your heart put there by your sister . If not removed , to solid ice will you freeze , forever . What ? No . But you can remove it , right ? I cannot . I 'm sorry , Kristoff . If it was her head , that would be easy . But only an act of true love can thaw a frozen heart . An act of true love ? A true love 's kiss , perhaps ? Something 's wrong . Are you all right ? Anna , we 've got to get you back to Hans . Hans . Pull us out , Sven . Olaf , come on ! I 'm coming ! Let 's go kiss Hans ! Who is this Hans ? We are here to find Princess Anna . Be on guard , but no harm is to come to the queen . Do you understand ? Yes , Your Grace . The queen . Go , go ! Come on ! There ! Up there ! Come on ! We got her . No . Please . Go around . Toss it . Stay away ! Look out ! Fire ! Fire ! Get her ! Ah ! Come on ! Grab his arm . Aim ... This way , this way ! Whoa ! Queen Elsa ! Do n't be the monster they fear you are . Oh , no . What have ... What have I done ? Why did you bring me here ? I could n't just let them kill you . But I 'm a danger to Arendelle . Get Anna . Anna has not returned . If you would just stop the winter . Bring back summer , please . Do n't you see ? I ca n't . You have to tell them to let me go . I will do what I can . Just hang in there . Come on , buddy , faster ! Oh , boy ! Whoa ! I 'll meet you guys at the castle ! Stay out of sight , Olaf . I will ! Hello ! It 's alive ! It 's Princess Anna ! Are you gonna be okay ? Do n't worry about me . Anna ! You had us worried sick . My Lady . Get her warm . And find Prince Hans , immediately . We will . Thank you . Make sure she 's safe . Oh , you poor girl , you 're freezing . Oh , let 's get you inside now and get you warm . I 'm going back out to look for Princess Anna . You cannot risk going out there again . If anything happens to her ... If anything happens to the princess , you are all Arendelle has left . He 's in here . Prince Hans . Anna . You 're so cold . Hans , you have to kiss me . What ? Now ! Now ! Slow down . We 'll give you two some privacy . What happened out there ? Elsa struck me with her powers . You said she would never hurt you . I was wrong . Anna . She froze my heart , and only an act of true love can save me . A true love 's kiss . Oh , Anna . If only there was someone out there who loved you . What ? You said you did . As thirteenth in line in my own kingdom , I did n't stand a chance . I knew I would have to marry into the throne somewhere . What ... What are you talking about ? As heir , Elsa was preferable , of course . But no one was getting anywhere with her . But you ... Hans ! You were so desperate for love , you were willing to marry me just like that . I figured after we married , I would have to stage a little accident for Elsa . Hans ! No . Stop . But then , she doomed herself , and you were dumb enough to go after her . Please . All that 's left now is to kill Elsa , and bring back summer . You 're no match for Elsa . No , you 're no match for Elsa . I , on the other hand , am the hero who is going to save Arendelle from destruction . You wo n't get away with this . Oh ... I already have . Please , somebody , help . Please . Please . It 's getting colder by the minute . If we do n't do something soon , we 'll all freeze to death . Prince Hans . Princess Anna is ... Dead . What ? What happened to her ? She was killed . By Queen Elsa . No ! Her own sister . At least we got to say our marriage vows before she died in my arms . There can be no doubt now . Queen Elsa is a monster , and we are all in grave danger . Prince Hans , Arendelle looks to you . With a heavy heart , I charge Queen Elsa of Arendelle with treason . And sentence her to death . Hurry up ! She 's dangerous . Move quickly . Careful . It wo n't open ! It 's frozen shut . Put your back into it ! Come on ! Push ! What is it , buddy ? Hey , watch it . What 's wrong with you ? I do n't understand you when you talk like that . Stop it ! Put me down ! No , Sven ! We 're not going back . She 's with her true love . What the ... Anna ! Come on ! Come on , boy . Help . Anna ! Oh , no . Olaf ? Olaf . Get away from there . Wow ! So , this is heat . I love it . Ooh ! But do n't touch it . So , where 's Hans ? What happened to your kiss ? I was wrong about him . It was n't true love . But we ran all the way here . Please , Olaf , you ca n't stay here . You 'll melt . I am not leaving here until we find some other act of true love to save you . Do you happen to have any ideas ? I do n't even know what love is . That 's okay , I do . Love is putting someone else 's needs before yours . Like , you know , how Kristoff brought you back here to Hans and left you forever . Kristoff loves me ? Wow , you really do n't know anything about love , do you ? Olaf , you 're melting . Some people are worth melting for . Just maybe not right this second . Do n't worry , I 've got it . We 're gonna get through ... Oh , wait . Hang on , I 'm getting something . It 's Kristoff and Sven ! They 're coming back this way . They ... They are ? Wow ! He 's really moving fast . I guess I was wrong . I guess Kristoff does n't love you enough to leave you behind . Help me up , Olaf . Please . No , no , no ! You need to stay by the fire and keep warm . I need to get to Kristoff . Why ? Oh , I know why ! There 's your act of true love right there ! Riding across the fjords like a valiant , pungent reindeer king ! Come on ! Look out ! Oh ! Uh ... Back this way . We 're trapped . Oh ... Whoa ! Slide , Anna ! We made it ! Go , go , go , go , go , go , go ! Come on , buddy , faster . Kristoff ! Keep going ! Kristoff ! Come on ! No . Whoa ! Whoa ! Sven ... Sven ! Good boy . Kristoff . Kristoff ... Anna ... Anna ! Elsa ! You ca n't run from this ! Just take care of my sister . Your sister ? She returned from the mountain weak and cold . She said that you froze her heart . No . I tried to save her , but it was too late . Her skin was ice . Her hair turned white . Your sister is dead . Because of you . No . Kristoff . Anna ! Elsa ? No ! Anna ! Oh . Anna ! No , no ! Please , no . Anna ? Anna ? Oh , Elsa . You sacrificed yourself for me ? I love you . An act of true love will thaw a frozen heart . Love will thaw . Love . Of course . Elsa ? Love ! I knew you could do it . Hands down , this is the best day of my life . And , quite possibly , the last . Oh , Olaf ! Hang on , little guy . Oh , oh , oh ! My own personal flurry ! Uh-uh-uh-uh . Anna ? But she froze your heart . The only frozen heart around here is yours . Wonderful ! Setting course , sir . I will return this scoundrel to his country . We shall see what his 12 big brothers think of his behavior . Arendelle thanks you , milord . This is unacceptable . I am a victim of fear . I 've been traumatized . Ah ! My neck hurts . Is there a doctor that I could see ? And I demand to see the queen ! Oh . I have a message from the queen . Arendelle will henceforth and forever no longer do business of any sort with Weaseltown . Weselton . It 's Weselton ! Let 's go . Come on , come on , come on ! Okay , okay , here I come . Pole ! Whoops ! Sorry . Okay , okay . Here we are . Oh ! I owe you a sled . Are you serious ? Yes ! And it 's the latest model . No , I ca n't accept this . You have to . No returns . No exchanges . Queen 's orders . She 's named you the Official Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer . What ? That 's not a thing . Oh , sure it is . And it even has a cup holder . Do you like it ? Like it ? I love it ! Whoa . I could kiss you ! I could . I mean , I 'd like to . I 'd ... May I ? We me . I mean , may we ? Wait , what ? We may . Mmm . Summer ! Ooh ... Hello . Are you ready ? Ice ! Ooh ! Whoo-hoo ... Swing me . Ooh ... I like the open gates . We are never closing them again . Oh , Elsa , they 're beautiful , but you know I do n't skate . Come on ! You can do it ! Look out . Reindeer coming through . I got it , I got it . I do n't got it , I do n't got it . Hey , guys ! That 's it , Olaf . Glide and pivot . And glide and pivot . Go . Oh ! The next stop is Broad Street . Broad Street will be next . Upstairs . This way . He didn 't come up this way ? Anything ? He 's not up here . Go back down . Excuse me . Excuse me . Go ahead and park around the corner . Visitors . Do you mind if I fetch my teeth ? Colonel , would you turn around , please ? Sit down on the bed . Let 's go . Uh , they 're in the ... The teeth are in the ... On the sink . Look at me . We are agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation . Look at me ! I 'm talking to you . We 've received information concerning your involvement in espionage . You can either cooperate with us right now , or you 'll be under arrest . Do you understand , Colonel ? No , not really . Why do you keep calling me " Colonel " ? You need to get dressed . We have to search your apartment . Would you mind if I , uh , cleaned my palette ? The paints , it 'll get ruined otherwise . It 's just behind you there . I have a cloth myself . Thank you . All right , start searching the place . Thank you . All right , search the mattress , the bed , the floorboards , his chair . Would you put that in the ashtray on the windowsill there ? Take a good look at that desk . Let 's see the desk . Wouldn 't want to get this ruined . Don 't say " my guy . " He 's not " my guy . " Yes , he 's " your guy . " Who are we talking about ? We 're talking about a guy who was insured by my client . So , don 't make him " my guy . " Okay , fine . My point is , the guy insured by your client , he doesn 't deny that any of these things happened . " These ... These things " ? Yes , these five things . Wait , hold it , hold it , hold it . Not five things . One thing . Clearly , it 's five things . Well , I 'm sorry , it 's not clear to me . Five things ? Explain it to me . It 's self- evident . Okay , then tell me what happened . Tell me the story in a way that makes sense for five things . Fine , absolutely . Your guy is ... Not my guy . Insured by my client . The guy insured by your client is driving down State Highway 19 when he loses control of his car and hits my five guys , the five guys who hired me to represent them because you 're not honoring your claim . You mean my client is not honoring the claim , the insurance company ? Mr . Donovan , we 're all clear on who 's who , here . Except my client honors every claim . They do , Mr . Bates . Every single legitimate claim , up to the limit of their liability , which is $100, 000 per accident , in the case of this man 's policy . And this is one claim . According to your description , " He hit my five guys . " The guy insured by my client had one accident . One , one , one . Losing control of the car and hitting five motorcyclists . From their point of view , five things happened . Well , look , Bob . May I ? Bob ? " Jim . " If I go bowling and I throw a strike , one thing happened . Ten things didn 't happen . Jim , my guys aren 't bowling pins , as much as your guy may have treated them as such . If ... Let me finish . Let me finish . If your house is insured for $100, 000 and a tornado carries it away , it carried away one house . It didn 't pick up every stick of furniture and destroy it in a separate incident . If that is what you 're saying , well , then there is never any limit to our liability and that is the end of the insurance business . And then , Bob , nobody is safe . Watters , Cowan and Donovan . How may I direct your call ? Morning , Mr . Donovan . Good morning , Alison . I moved your 9 : 00 a . m . with Prudential , sir . Why did you do that ? I asked her to . Is everything all right , Tom ? Why don 't you leave your stuff with Alison . Come on inside . Something pretty important has come up . Somebody 's here to see us . Natalie 's getting your coffee . Nescafe , cream , two lumps , right ? That 's right . Thanks . Lynn ! Jim ! Nice to see you again . How 's the family ? Great , good . Thanks . How 's Annie ? Homicidal . We had the in- laws for the holiday . Well , if she acts on it , she 'll have good representation . Now , what 's up ? Okay , here 's the thing . The Soviet spy they caught , we want you to defend him . Here 's the indictment . Wow . I 'm not sure I wanna pick that up . The accused doesn 't know any lawyers . The federal court tossed it into our lap . The Bar Committee took a vote . You 're the unanimous choice . It was important to us ... It 's important to our country , Jim , that this man is seen as getting a fair shake . American justice will be on trial . Well , of course , when you put it that way , it 's an honor to be asked . But , Lynn , I 'm an insurance lawyer . I haven 't done criminal work in years . It 's like riding a bike , isn 't it ? You distinguished yourself at Nuremberg . I was on the prosecution team . Not the point . You 're no stranger to criminal law . Jim , look at the situation . The man is publicly reviled . And I will be , too . Yes , in more ignorant quarters . But that 's exactly why this has to be done , and capably done . It can 't look like our justice system tosses people on the ash heap . Suppose I did , what 's the evidence look like ? Pretty overwhelming . Great . Great . Everyone will hate me but at least I' ll lose . Well , what do you think , Tom ? The firm will suffer . I have work here . I think it 's a patriotic duty . It 's an important mission . I told Lynn , the firm can 't say no , and you 'd have a tough time saying no , too . I think you have to defend the son of a bitch . So , you 're doing it ? Doing what ? Defending Abel , the Soviet spy . I may . I have to speak to ... Wait , how do you know ? Did they post it on the bulletin board ? No , I ... I was talking to Richard Earl ... Look , if I do this , I 'm going to need your help . Can you work tonight ? Well , I have a dinner date , sir . It 's Tuesday , right ? Yeah , no , I 'm free , completely free . Thank you , sir . But it 's also an honor . And the Bar Association asked me because they want to show that even a spy gets a capable advocate . Well , maybe it 's the kind of honor we could do without . Hey , honey , what are you doing home ? I got stood up . Well , that 's despicable . Who is this knot- head ? I 'd rather not say . Well , sit down . We just started . People are scared . They 're building bomb shelters to protect themselves from people like this man . I go to the store , people are buying canned food and potassium tablets . It 's all about this man and what he represents . He 's a threat to all of us . A traitor . Who 's a traitor ? The Rosenbergs were traitors . Who were they ? They gave atomic secrets to the Russians . They were Americans . They betrayed their country . You can 't accuse Abel of being a traitor . He 's not an American . Oh , listen to yourself . You 're defending him already . You 're rehearsing it on me . You said you were just thinking about taking it . I am just thinking about it , just very hard . Everyone deserves a defense . Every person matters . Jim , what do we deserve ? Do you know how people will look at us ? The family of a man trying to free a traitor ? He 's not a traitor , Mary . Yes , yes . Roger , get that ! He 's not a traitor ... Why do I have to do all the work ? Oh ! You wait till we say grace . I 'm hungry ! He 's about the most unpopular man in this country , and you 're trying to take second place ! Yeah , and I 'm third . Carol , you just dated the wrong guy . I wanna eat . Mary , don 't make this an argument when we 're not having an argument . You 're against him , I 'm for him ? No , I 'm not for him . I 'm not for the Russians spying on us . I 'm for his right to have a defense in a court of law , which is why they call it a court of law . I didn 't mean to interrupt dinner . A court of law ... Hey , Doug . Oh , no , not at all . Hello , Doug . Jim was just flailing . I 'm not flailing . Go ahead , Doug , you can join us for dinner . We 're having meatloaf tonight . So , you came over to help Jim think about whether he 's taking the case ? Oh , we 're taking it ! It 's exciting , isn 't it ? Lord , we thank thee for thy blessings we are about to receive . Thy bounty through Christ , our Lord . Amen . Good morning , sir . My name is Jim Donovan . These are my credentials . I am a partner in Watters , Cowan and Donovan . I was admitted to the New York Bar in 1941 . You have been charged with three counts and 19 overt acts . Conspiracy to transmit United States defense and atomic secrets to the Soviet Union , conspiracy to gather secrets , and failing to register as a foreign agent . Do many foreign agents register ? If you don 't mind my asking , sir , since your arrest , where have you been ? I couldn 't say for certain . You don 't know ? They drove me to an airport and put me on a plane , took me off the plane . Somewhere hot . It 's hot here . Hotter , very humid . They put me in a room . Were you beaten ? No . I was talked to . Offers were made . What do you mean ? Offers of employment , to work for your government . I was told if I cooperated , no further charges would be made against me . And I would be given money . Hmm . And you declined ? As you see . Well , of course I can 't endorse that . I feel duty- bound to urge you to cooperate with the U . S . government . Well , I said no . Perhaps you could relay to your friends at the CIA that I meant it . No , no , no . I ... I don 't work for the agency . I don 't work for the government . I am here to offer my services as your legal counsel . If you accept them as such , I work for you . If I accept you ? Are you good at what you do ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm pretty good . Have you represented many accused spies ? No , not yet . This will be a first for the both of us . Yes . All right . " All right " ? You accept ? Yes , all right . Good , okay . Let 's start here . If you are firm in your resolve not to cooperate with the U . S . government ... I am . Yeah . Then do not talk to anybody else about your case , inside of government or out . Except to me , to the extent that you trust me . I have a mandate to serve you . Nobody else does . Quite frankly , everybody else has an interest in sending you to the electric chair . All right . You don 't seem alarmed . Would it help ? I ... I would like materials to draw with . That 's not possible . A pencil , a piece of paper . Cigarettes . Please ? Mr . Donovan , you have men like me doing the same for your country . If they were caught , I 'm sure that you would wish them to be treated well . What 's your name ? Francis Gary Powers . Rank , service ? First Lieutenant , United States Air Force . Do you have any association with the Soviet Union , Lieutenant Powers ? Kidding ? Just answer the questions , Lieutenant . Yes , no , or as simply as you can . Do you have any association with the Soviet Union ? Hell , no . Do you know why you 're here ? Mmm- mmm . Is that a no ? Yes . I mean ... No , it 's just " no . " Yes , I have absolutely no idea why I 'm here . Eyes front , Lieutenant . Yes , sir . How 'd you do in there , Gary ? Pretty good . Think I got my name right . You probably outscored Shinn , then . Who 's winning ? Uh , that would be me . Oh . Well , deal me in . So , these are all mine , then . I told you boys not to play with him . Okay , drivers , here 's the deal . You 've been selected for a mission which you are not to discuss with anyone outside of this room . No one . I don 't care who you trust . Wife , mother , sweetheart . The good Lord when you pray at night . You don 't tell any of them anything of what I 'm about to tell you . Each of you drivers has met certain qualifications . High level security clearance . Exceptional pilot ratings in excess of the required hours flight time in a single- seat aircraft . We are engaged in a war . This war does not , for the moment , involve men- at- arms . It involves information . You will be collecting information . You will be gathering intelligence about the enemy . The intelligence you gather could give us the upper hand in a full thermonuclear exchange with the Soviet Union . Or it could prevent one . For public purposes , as far as your wife or mother or sweetheart or the good Lord above , your mission does not exist . If it does not exist , you do not exist . You cannot be shot down . You cannot be captured . You work for the CIA now . So , Jim , I heard your guy is speaking with a phony accent . Does he keep that up all the time ? Actually , I 'm pretty sure that 's just the way he talks . He 's got the Russian name but a British passport . Well , I doubt that that 's genuine . So , Jim , where are we ? I see here ... Yes , uh , Judge , you see , I just don 't think that three weeks is going to do it , here . We ... We got a massive amount of evidence , as you know . You wanna postpone ? Six weeks . I mean , there 's just myself and my associate , basically . Jim , is this serious ? Sir ? Is this serious ? Yes . Yes , indeed , it is . You can see in the filing ... Jim , this man is a Soviet spy . Allegedly . Come on , Counselor ! Your Honor . Of course , I salute you . We all salute you for taking on a thankless task . This man has to have due process . But let 's not kid each other . He 'll receive a capable defense . And , God willing , he 'll be convicted . Come on , Counselor . Let 's not play games with this . Not in my courtroom . We have a date and we 're going to trial . Taxi ! Taxi ! I see your light on ! Son of a bitch . Can 't wait to get back to Manhattan . His light was on , right ? Son of a bitch . Against their level of comfort . The statute hasn 't changed . Oh , excuse me , sir . Pardon me . Sorry . Oh ! Mr . Donovan . What ? What ? CIA . Yeah . I just wanted to chat . How 's the case going ? Case is going great . Couldn 't be better . Mmm- hmm . Has your guy talked ? Excuse me . You met him . Has he talked ? Has he said anything yet ? We 're not having this conversation . No , of course not . No , I mean , we really are not having it . You 're asking me to violate attorney- client privilege . Oh , come on , Counselor . You know , I wish people like you would quit saying " Oh , come on , Counselor . " I didn 't like it the first time it happened today . A judge said it to me twice . And the more I hear it , the more I don 't like it . Okay , well , listen , I understand attorney- client privilege . I understand all the legal gamesmanship . And I understand that 's how you make a living . But I 'm talking to you about something else . The security of your country . And I 'm sorry if the way I put it offends you . But we need to know what Abel is telling you . You understand me , Donovan ? We need to know . Don 't go " Boy Scout " on me . We don 't have a rule book , here . You 're Agent Hoffman , yeah ? Yeah . German extraction . Yeah , so ? My name 's Donovan . Irish . Both sides , mother and father . I 'm Irish , you 're German . But what makes us both Americans ? Just one thing . One , one , one . The rule book . We call it the Constitution and we agree to the rules , and that 's what makes us Americans . It 's all that makes us Americans so don 't tell me there 's no rule book , and don 't nod at me like that , you son of a bitch . Do we need to worry about you ? Not if I 'm left alone to do my job . From this moment forward you will not refer to the U- 2 as a spy plane or reconnaissance aircraft . You will refer to it as " The Article . " The Article has an 80- foot wingspan . It 's powered by a single Pratt and Whitney J57 P- 37 engine . 10, 000 pounds of thrust and a maximum speed of 430 miles an hour . She may not be quick , but at your cruising altitude of 70, 000 feet , nothing will come close to you . 70, 000 ? The idea is the enemy doesn 't even know you 're there . It looks kind of flimsy . Every extra pound of weight costs a foot in altitude , and we need to accommodate the cameras . That 's a 4, 500- millimeter lens , times three . A pin- sharp panoramic camera four times as powerful as any aerial reconnaissance cameras we 've ever used . You 're gonna be taking pictures , lots of pictures . At 70, 000 feet , The Article can photograph 2, 000 square miles of territory in one pass . Now , drivers , give Agent Sumner your undivided attention . The items you will need on your mission are over here . B camera , Revere 8 model 40 magazine , Keystone Capri K- 25 , silver . Hollow- handle shaving brush . Complete set of cipher tables on edible silver foil . Specialist photographic equipment . Yeah , we , uh ... We get the idea . Thank you . Uh , excuse me , Agent , uh , Bosco . " Blasco . " Sir . There seems to be a subsection to this list here . Well , most of this stuff came from his studio , but the rest is from the hotel room he was holed up in . Where we found him . The hotel room you searched ? Well , yeah . Can I see the warrant ? The what ? Yeah , explain this to me . There was a warrant . There was a warrant . A civil detention writ for the arrest of an alien , but there was no search warrant for suspicion of criminal activity . So , the search and the evidence that is the fruit of that search , that 's all tainted and should not be admitted . What protections is he due , Your Honor ? The man is not ... The man is what ? He 's Rudolf Ivanovich Abel . He is a Soviet citizen . He 's not an American . 1886 , Yick Wo v . Hopkins . The court held that even aliens , in that case Chinese immigrants , could not be held to answer for a crime without due process of law , including any alien that entered the country illegally . The Department of Justice has its first allegiance to the United States . I don 't see how an alien , if he 's here illegally , how he suffered deprivation of rights . Rights as what ? An American ? Rights as what , Counselor ? We 're in a battle for civilization . This Russian spy came here to threaten our way of life . Now , I have a courtroom of people waiting . Get out there , sit beside the Russian . Let 's get this over and done with . And your motion is denied . He should take some insurance out on himself . How did we do ? In there ? Uh ... Not too good . Apparently , you 're not an American citizen . That 's true . And according to your boss , you 're not a Soviet citizen either . Well , the boss isn 't always right but he 's always the boss . Do you never worry ? Would it help ? All rise . " I pledge allegiance to the Flag " of the United States of America , " and to the Republic for which it stands , " one Nation under God , indivisible , " with liberty and justice for all . " First , you have to know what happens when an atomic bomb explodes . There is a bright flash , brighter than the sun . It can smash in buildings , break windows all over town . But if you duck and cover like Bert , you will be much safer . There are two kinds of attack , with warning and without any warning . Mmm . What 's going on in here ? Okay , Dad , this is really important . When the war begins , the first thing they do is cut off all the water and all the electricity . So the first thing we should do is keep this filled , use the shower in your room , use the sink downstairs , the garden hose outside ... Those are good ideas . But , Roger , I don 't see this as being something you ever have to worry about . Yeah , but when you hear the sirens , there may not be enough time to fill the tub and the sinks . Not gonna be any sirens ... What is this ? When the bomb comes , the Reds will aim for the Empire State Building . But the bomb goes off at 10, 000 feet up . In Life magazine , it 's called an airburst , and if the bomb is 50 megatons , the blast wave goes out and out and out and melts everything from here to here . Including where we live . Here . Yeah , right there . But , you know , Roger , no one is dropping atomic bombs on us . But the Russians want to . You know that Russian guy you 're defending ? He 's here to get things ready for the guys who drop the bombs . No , no , he 's not ... Not here for that . He 's not even Russian . He was born , we think , in Northern England . Yeah , but he 's a spy for Russia . I don 't even understand what you 're doing . You 're not a Communist , so why are you defending one ? Well , because it 's my job . It never used to be . In the case of the United States of America versus Rudolf Abel , as to the first count in the indictment , how do you find the defendant ? Guilty or not guilty ? Guilty . As to the second count ? Guilty . As to the third count ? Guilty . Your Honor , I make a motion to set aside these guilty verdicts against the weight of evidence . Denied . The jury is discharged . Thank you all . I would like to add that , if I were one of you , I would 've reached the same verdict . Sentencing will be November 15 . The death sentence is not a foregone conclusion . Don 't worry . I 'm not afraid to die , Mr . Donovan . Although it wouldn 't be my first choice . You left this behind . Oh , thank you . Oh , thank you very much ! You 've never asked me if the charges were true . If I am indeed a spy . This is how we do it . The case against you matters . Making them prove it matters . The fiction is ... Whether you did it or not doesn 't matter . The state has to prove it , that you 're a spy . So you 're not curious ? No , not really . I always assumed you were an artist . My wife , she 's the artist . She 's a musician in the Children 's Orchestra of Moscow . What instrument ? The harp . Oh . Then , she 's an angel . Standing there like that , you remind me of a man who used to come to our house when I was young . My father used to say , " Watch this man . " So I did , every time he came . And never once did he do anything remarkable . And I remind you of him ? This one time , I was about the age of your son . Our house was overrun by partisan border guards . Dozens of them . My father was beaten , my mother was beaten , and this man , my father 's friend , he was beaten . And I watched this man . Every time they hit him he stood back up again . So they hit him harder . Still , he got back to his feet . I think because of this they stopped the beating . They let him live . I remember them saying it . It sort of means , like , uh , " standing man . " Standing man . Hello , Jim ! Millie , you 're a vision . Mortie 's busy getting kitted out . But come on in . Scotch , Jim ? Oh , yes , please . Thank you . Uh , just a drop of water . Your Honor . Hello , Jim ! Just going out . Got a few minutes though . March of Dimes thing . Millie is active . Well , thank you for seeing me . I just wanted to give you my two cents on the sentencing . And I thought maybe I should pester you at home as not all of my points are narrowly legal . Yeah , well , it 's that kind of case . I hope I wasn 't too scratchy during the trial but it 's exactly what you say . Nothing about this is narrowly legal . There are bigger issues . Bigger issues ! Thank you , thank you . Uh ... Sir ... I think it could be considered in the best interests of the United States that Abel remain alive . Why ? I 'm not saying I' ve made up my mind but if he was gonna cooperate , work with the government , he would 've done it already . - True , but the issue here ... - You can 't ... Excuse me . You can 't say it 's in the best interest of the United States that he spend the rest of his days in a prison cell . How is this the national interest ? Not the incarceration itself , sir . It is possible that , in the foreseeable future , an American of equivalent rank might be captured by Soviet Russia . We might want to have someone to trade . Wow . That sounds like spinning what- ifs . You could do that till the cows come home . It 's my business , what- ifs . I 'm in insurance . And there 's nothing implausible about this one . It 's entirely in the realm of what could happen . It 's the kind of probability that people buy insurance for . If we send this guy to his death , we leave ourselves wide open . No policy in our back pocket for the day the storm comes . Nice speech . Sir , there is also the humanitarian argument . Should he die for doing the job they sent him to do ? All right , Counselor . I gotta run . Good seeing you , Jim . I' ll walk you out . All rise . The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York is now in session . The honorable Mortimer Byers presiding . Be seated . The defendant will please rise . In the measured judgment of this court the following sentence , based upon the jury 's verdict of guilty as to each count of the indictment , is believed to meet the test which has been stated . Pursuant to the verdict of guilty as to all counts , the defendant is committed to the custody of the Attorney General of the United States for imprisonment in a federal institution to be selected by him for a period of 30 years . Marshals , you may take the defendant into custody . No ... No electrocution ? No . No , no . Why aren 't we hanging him ? In the name of God , why aren 't we hanging him ? Sit down , sir ! He 's a spy ! He 's killing us with his lies ! In the name of God , why aren 't we hanging him ? That 's right ! He 's a spy ! Mr . Donovan ! Mr . Donovan ! Just one question . Just one question , sir . My hat ! My hat ! My hat ! Nobody here has a comment . Mr . and Mrs . Donovan are not answering questions . How do you feel now that this national nightmare is over ? Mr . Donovan , are you happy with the verdict ? We 're ... We 're in firm ground on , uh , for a case on appeal . Appeal ? Appeal , yes . Jim , you did a great job . You fulfilled your mandate and then some . But the man is a spy . The verdict is correct and there 's no reason to appeal it . There 's ample procedural reason . We know the search is tainted . And Fourth Amendment issues will always weigh more heavily in an appellate forum . We 've got a good shot . What the goddamn hell are you talking about ? We were supposed to show he had a capable defense , which we did . Why are you citing the goddamn Constitution at me ? Tom , if you look me in the eye and tell me we don 't have grounds for an appeal , I' ll drop it right now . I 'm not saying that . You know what I 'm saying . Tom is saying there 's a cost to these things . That 's right . A cost to both your family and your firm . I' ve missed music . They checked the radio to make sure there was no transmitter in it . I 'm sure they did . Shostakovich . Mmm . That 's a very great artist , Shostakovich . Uh , I think our strongest grounds for reversal are constitutional . Our best chance is if the Supreme Court agrees to review our case . Jim ... You should be careful . Careful . ♪ 77 Sunset Strip Edward Byrnes . ♪ 77 Sunset Strip And Richard Long .

Should it become necessary to abandon the aircraft over Soviet territory , then there 's a two- and- a- half pound explosive charge contained within the fuselage . Now , first , you activate the circuits . But to start the 70- second timer , you need to flip the switch marked " Destruct . " It is imperative that these flights remain a secret and this equipment does not fall into enemy hands . What about us ? I don 't know if you 're kidding , Lieutenant Powers . I 'm not . What you know about the plane is as secret as the plane itself . If capture is a foregone conclusion , you go down with your plane . Now , if you think you can ditch and get away , if you 're close enough to a border , fine . You know the ejection protocol . But if you ditch , you bring the dollar with you . All right , there 's a pin inside . You scratch your skin anywhere , it 's instantaneous . If you think you are about to be captured , you use it . Drivers , you understand me ? Spend the dollar . Mr . Chief Justice , and may it please the court . The " Cold War " is not just a phrase , Your Honor . It 's not just a figure of speech . Truly , a battle is being fought between two competing views of the world . I contend that Rudolf Ivanovich Abel , " Colonel Abel , " as he was called even by the men who arrested him , is our foe in that battle . Auxiliary power ? Connected and on . Oxygen seat- pack supply ? Supply at 1, 800 psi . Inverter ? On , light out . He was treated as a combatant in that war until it no longer suited our government to so treat him . Accordingly , he was not given the protections we give our own citizens . He was subjected to treatment that , however appropriate for a suspected enemy , was not appropriate to a suspected criminal . Fuel transfer ? Transfer switch off . Destructor ? Destructor safety . Climb data card . Installed in aircraft . I know this man . If the charge is true , he serves a foreign power but he serves it faithfully . If he is a soldier in the opposing army , he is a good soldier . He has not fled the field of battle to save himself . He has refused to serve his captor . He has refused to betray his cause . He has refused to take the coward 's way out . The coward must abandon his dignity before he abandons the field of battle . That , Rudolf Abel will never do . Shouldn 't we , by giving him the full benefit of the rights that define our system of government , show this man who we are ? Who we are . Is that not the greatest weapon we have in this Cold War ? Will we stand by our cause less resolutely than he stands by his ? The President announced that a NASA weather plane disappeared four days ago north of Turkey . And the Space Administration fears that its pilot died in the crash . Radar showed the plane wandering off course deep into Soviet territory before contact was lost , complicating any effort to recover it or the remains of the pilot . Now to news out of Washington . In a close vote today , the Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Russian spy Rudolf Ivanovich Abel , five votes to four . The case presented civil liberties issues , according to the Russian 's lawyer , James B . Donovan . When asked how he felt about today 's loss , Mr . Donovan simply said , " Tired .

The term of the punishment , including preliminary detention , shall be counted from May first , nineteen hundred and sixty . Mr . Donovan , thank you so much for coming . It 's a pleasure to meet you , Mr . Dulles . It 's an honor , sir . Nescafe , cream , two lumps . Thank you . Okay , this letter you received . Seems pretty clear that the Soviets are making an overture here . They 're doing it through East Germany because they still don 't want to acknowledge Abel as a Soviet citizen , much less a Soviet spy . So ... Lot of fiction going on . Yes , sir , but to what end ? They got our guy , our spy pilot . We 've got their guy . Prisoner exchange , I think that 's what they 're after . Which could hardly be a surprise to you , Counselor . It 's an eventuality that I think you foresaw . Yes , I sure did , and I 'm so rarely right . Well , congratulations . Red letter day . Now , we have our man over there . Powers . Good man , but with a head full of classified information . Abel has a head full of classified information , too , but he hasn 't given us a lick . And , sir , take it from me , he won 't . Yes , we know that , but the Russians don 't . They want their man back before he cracks . And we want Powers back for the same reasons . I think you are saying , sir , that there might be a happy ending for everyone . Yes , if we , um , indulge their fiction . We want you to negotiate the swap because you 're a private citizen , so it 's not governments talking . They don 't acknowledge Abel as a Soviet citizen , and we don 't acknowledge East Germany as a sovereign country . We haven 't recognized East Berlin since it was annexed by the Soviets in ´45 . So I act as a negotiator , representing ... You 're not representing anybody . Not a government official . You have no official standing . So , some fiction on our side as well . Correct . Which means , of course , you can 't rely on any acknowledgment or help if things go south . CIA can 't be responsible . We can 't be embarrassed . Where do they want this negotiation to take place ? There . " There " ? East Berlin . Well , isn 't East Berlin getting rather ... Oh , yes , the place is getting complicated . Yeah , complicated . The Soviet side has been setting up checkpoints for the past few months to try to stop people hemorrhaging to the Western sectors , and it hasn 't worked . We have intelligence to suggest that they may go one step further and wall off the entire Eastern sector . Okay , that 's it in a nutshell . The decision is entirely yours . You need time to kick it around . No . No , I don 't . Well , fine . Fine . Best that this all remains confidential . Let 's not discuss any of this with , uh , Mary or with anyone else . Share the correspondence only with us . Let us know what they want to do and when . I' ve got no client , no wife , no country . Don 't know what I 'm doing or when or who for .

But no one knows who 's who , but essentially they 're all Russian , right ? Well , Soviet . Well , we think so . What do you mean ? Could we turn up the heat in here ? There 's a wrinkle . They might try to throw you a curveball . Try and get you to accept another prisoner other than Powers . Another American ? The , uh , East German Stasi picked up an American student . Frederic Pryor . Uh , the kid they found on the wrong side of the Wall . He 's a grad student out of Yale . - Came over here to study economics . - Mmm- hmm . So , they 're making noises about trying this kid for espionage . Grave offense , capital crime . Well . Vogel got in touch with us , said he represents Pryor . Wait a minute . Vogel represents Mrs . Abel and this ... This kid ? Yeah , he 's busy . Well , so , what is he ? Vogel , is he , uh , East German or is he Russian ? Well , try to figure it out when you meet him . At Russian embassy , East Berlin , noon tomorrow . Hoffman will show you how to get there . Wait , show me how to get there ? I 'm gonna have an escort . Right ? Well , that was the plan but like I said , there 's a wrinkle . I won 't be taking you . Decision 's been made . No U . S . government personnel are to cross the border until further notice . How come ? It 's too dangerous . Yeah , the East Germans grabbed this kid . There 's a degree of impunity that we had not anticipated . The point is that the East German agenda and the Russian agenda may not be the same thing . Try and figure it out and act accordingly . And try to make a deal . Powers for Abel . Well , what about this college kid , Pryor ? Mmm- mmm . Don 't fall for that . We can get him out another time . Powers is the whole ball game . Where 's your room ? I' ll be staying at the Hilton . It 's not far . This is a number here in West Berlin . Memorize it and give it back to me . No , no . I ... I mean , now . The Soviets keep cutting the international lines but local calls are okay . Someone will pick up day and night . Now , this docket attached to your passport will serve as your ticket into and out of the Eastern Soviet sector . The meeting with Vogel is set for noon tomorrow . There are only a few routes left to the East . You take the S- Bahn , the station we showed you on the way in . You 're gonna get off at the Friedrichstrasse station here and walk to the Soviet embassy on Unter den Linden here . Look at the map now . You shouldn 't take it with you . You 're looking at a map , you 're an American , you 're a spy . You could well be detained . Just avoid interacting with people generally . You don 't ... You don 't belong , so don 't stick out . Food is scarce over there and things have started to fall apart . There are gangs , and rule of law is less firmly established over there . And definitely stay away from the Wall . On their side , there 's a line cleared of buildings along the Wall . They call it the " Death Line . " Cross it and you 'll be shot . Is there any outcome here where I 'm not either detained or shot ? Don 't worry too much about what Michener said . No , I 'm worried about what you 're saying . This kid , Pryor , that the East Germans have , how old is he ? Twenty- five . Why ? Same age as Dougie . Who ? Eh , an associate of mine . Frederic Pryor . Okay , okay , okay . Danke . So , we apologize if this offends . Uh ... Coat ? Okay . Do you understand English ? Yes , sir . I 'm James Donovan . I 'm here to meet a Mr . Vogel . Mr . Vogel . He doesn 't work here . I 'm just supposed to meet him . That 's all I know . Mr . Donovan ! So we finally meet you . I 'm Helen Abel . How is our husband ? Oh . He 's fine . How is my Rudolf ? As good as can be expected . And we will get him back , yes ? This is our daughter . How do you do ? Lydia . Are you Mr . Vogel ? No , no , no ! I 'm not Vogel . I 'm cousin Drews . This is Rudolf 's beloved cousin Drews . Yes , cousin Drews . I am cousin Drews . Cousin Drews , yes . I 'm Helen Abel . When will you see him ? When will your government release him ? I 'm a little , uh , lost here . I 'm supposed to meet a Mr . Vogel . Oh , Mr . Vogel is our lawyer . We were supposed to negotiate , uh , the exchange . To bring Rudolf here ? Yes , yes , to bring him here . But it doesn 't happen unilaterally , do you understand ? It has to be an exchange . Not here ? Shh . Shh . Shh . Mr . Donovan ? Mr . Vogel . No , no , no . Goodness . My name is Schischkin . Ivan Schischkin . I 'm the second secretary of the Soviet embassy . It wouldn 't be appropriate for Mr . Vogel to join us . He is a German national . So you aren 't here to ... To facilitate this meeting . Uh , perhaps Mrs . Abel would like to compose herself privately ? And let Mr . Donovan and myself to talk ? Thank you . So , I 'm confused . Yes . Uh , I don 't care who I talk to if it 's about an exchange of personnel . Are you the person to talk to ? Yes , yes , yes , of course . Uh , we should talk . Please , have a seat , Mr . Donovan . Uh , how did you arrive to the Eastern sector ? The train . The S- Bahn . Ah , and you were alone ? Yeah . And you are credentialed ? Now , you must know about me , sir . I 'm a private citizen . I 'm a lawyer in Brooklyn in the United States , and I' ve taken time out of my busy schedule to help my client , Rudolf Abel . I 'm authorized to arrange an exchange of Abel for Francis Gary Powers . This is a full pardon of Abel that will be signed when the exchange actually takes place . This is the only reason I 'm here . I hope and expect to make this arrangement quickly . Abel for Francis Gary Powers and Frederic Pryor . Mmm , we don 't have Pryor . No ? You don 't ? I' ve heard of Pryor , but he 's held by the German Democratic Republic , not by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics . Well , I' ll tell you the first problem . The names of your countries are too long . Yes , yes . If we release Powers , it is only to promote a goodwill between our countries . So , it cannot be an exchange . Perhaps ... Perhaps you could release Abel as a token of goodwill to our friends in Germany , and then , some months later , we would release Powers . There is an idea . No . That just won 't work for us at all . See , we need this to be an exchange . You can call it what you want , but an exchange it must be . We can have Abel here within 48 hours . We need Powers at the same time we give you Abel . Hmm . This is ... Can we call this the " impatient plan " ? Well , you can call it whatever you want . I can relay your impatient plan to Moscow , see what they say ... But they will wonder why so impatient . Because I have a cold . And I don 't live in Berlin and I want to go home . They will think , " Well , the Americans must have gotten " all the information that Abel had to give . " And now they 're impatient to trade him , " hoping to get in return this man , Powers , " that , perhaps , has not yet given up " all the information that he has to give . " This is not an equitable trade , sir . But what you 're saying is , if Powers has given up everything he knows , then Moscow would trade ? Why wouldn 't they ? As for Abel , if he dies in an American prison , the next Russian operative who gets caught might think twice about keeping his mouth shut . And you never know . Abel might want to see the sky again and decide to trade Russian secrets for small American favors . How can we know this ? We little men , we just do our jobs . Like Lieutenant Powers . He 's just a pilot . He was making photographs from 70, 000 feet when he was shot from the sky . People in my country consider this an act of war . We have to get off this merry- go- round , sir . The next mistake our countries make could be the last one . We need to have the conversation our governments can 't . I will ask Moscow . Who knows what they will say . There are a lot of people , Mr . Donovan , who doesn 't want this exchange to ever take place . Can you come back tomorrow to discuss their answer ? Powers for Abel . And Frederic Pryor . As I said , Pryor is in the hands of the organs of State Security of the German Democratic Republic . I 'm confident you can make arrangements . I am merely a secretary in the embassy of foreign power . Okay , okay . You have to see Mr . Vogel . I' ll give you his address . There actually is a Mr . Vogel ? Why would you imagine otherwise ? Uh , it 's a short cab ride . And please , Mr . Donovan , wear an overcoat in this weather . I had mine stolen from me . What do you expect ? It was from Saks Fifth Avenue . Wasn 't it ? Mr . Donovan . Mr . Vogel . Please come in . Danke . Sorry about the embassy . But the Soviets decided not to host me . Very irritating . I am still trying to grasp each party 's ... Status ? Yes . And interest in the proceedings . Oh . It 's a new world . All very disorienting , isn 't it ? Let me tell you what I have to offer . I 'm a good friend ... " Friend . " No , he 's older . " Protege " ? Of the attorney general of the German Democratic Republic . Sit down , please . This unfortunate , Frederic Pryor , he was in the wrong place at the wrong time . But every accident , properly viewed , is an opportunity , isn 't it , Mr . Donovan ? Well ... Your country refuses to recognize the German Democratic Republic . They prefer to make up stories that the GDR doesn 't exist , for instance . Sorry . As a means of forcing your government 's recognition of this real place , sir , in which you find yourself , the GDR , the attorney general is happy to negotiate with you as a representative of your government for Mr . Pryor 's return . Mr . Vogel , I 'm not here as a representative of my government . All right . I think that 's childish , Mr . Donovan . Well , I ... I have no official status . Fine . You do not represent the USA , I do not represent the GDR . My client is Lydia Abel , Rudolf 's wife . And I have also ... Lydia is the daughter . Helen is the wife . Well ... I am prepared to offer Frederic Pryor 's exchange for Rudolf Abel 's . Then let 's be clear . We will produce Rudolf Abel . You will produce , at the same time , the student , Pryor . At the same time ? Absolutely . The exchange on offer is a Russian at the end of his life for an American student at the start of his . Schischkin ? He 's not an embassy secretary . Ivan Schischkin is the KGB 's chief in western Europe . Well , whatever he is , he 's relaying our proposal to Moscow and they 'll decide . Could I borrow a coat ? I lost mine . How did you lose your coat ? You know , spy stuff . I' ll get you another coat . Good , because ... So who is , uh ... Who is this Vogel ? Him , we don 't know . He might be what you said he said he is . Friend of the attorney general . Just some guy the GDR tapped to handle this . Sounds like the East Germans are fighting for a place at our table . The GDR gets Abel back for the Russians , winning their respect ... And capturing the headlines for their cause . Which , of course , puts East Germany on the map . But we don 't care about their map . Stick with the Russians . Stick with the Russians . It 's Powers for Abel . So , does all this mean this might actually happen ? Yeah , that 's what you seem to be telling me . We 'll put Abel on a plane , he 'll be here Friday . So , if Schischkin gets the okay , all that 's left is the mechanics of the trade . How we swap our guy for their guy . Our " guys . " Two guys . Powers and Pryor . No , now don 't go bleeding heart on me . Powers is the whole ball game . Forget this Ivy League boy , who obviously thought it was a good idea to study Soviet economics in Berlin in the middle of the Cold War . Powers is who we need . You don 't even like Powers . Everybody hates Powers . He didn 't kill himself and he let the commies parade him on television . He 's the most hated man in America . After Rudolf Abel , maybe . And me . Now wake up ! I gotta sleep . I just gotta sleep . I told you , you can sleep once we talk what we need to talk . You must focus on me . Your government doesn 't care about you . You know that . Any of you . You know that twelve U- 2 pilots incurred brain damage ? They 're vegetables because of altitude , insufficient oxygen . But they keep you flying , Gary . You and your friends . They gave you this . A scratcher , yes ? Potassium cyanide . Does that look like they care about you ? What is the construction of the destructor unit ? By what means is this unit operated ? With what explosives is the unit charged , and what destruction is it capable of ? I don 't know . The pilots were never shown any of the equipment . How wide far can the radar map an area during an overflight ? I don 't know , I don 't know ! Were you making the overflight on April 9th over the industrial area and MiG bomber base at Baranovichi ? I was not . This was my first overflight . I need to know about engine- out to glide ratio . How the plane gets so high . We know it reaches altitude of 70, 000 feet . Gary , we know this . And I need to know where the planes have flown . Where they have flown , Gary . And we must have this talk now . Now . And then you can sleep a little . Sir , wake up . Wake up , sir . Sir , can you come with me , please ? Yeah . We gotta move . Yeah , of course . Can you come with me , please ? Yeah . Okay . Got your glasses ? Uh- huh . What time is it ? It 's late , but we need to talk , and then we need to get on a plane , okay ? Yeah . Yep . Upsy- daisy ! Upsy- daisy . That 's right . There we go . Keep it moving . Thank you . Other way , other way . There we go . You say a plane ? This way , please . Keep moving . So , I received a favorable decision from Moscow on your proposal that we help our friends in the German Democratic Republic by exchanging Mr . Powers for Mr . Abel . That 's swell . May I suggest the Glienicke Bridge as a place of a swap ? Why not Checkpoint Charlie ? We 're not looking for publicity . The Glienicke Bridge is very quiet , especially early in the morning . Glienicke Bridge . I' ll run that by our side . We can have Abel here on Friday . So , Saturday morning ? Always impatience , yeah ? I want to get home and get into bed . So , Saturday morning ? 5 : 30 ? All right . We 're done here . This is a number , in case anything should come up . All right . Someone will answer at any hour . I don 't expect to use it . Shall we toast the arrangement ? Why not ? Armenian brandy . Good bracer for your cold . Thank you . Would you mind ... This is not part of our business but I 'd like to ask you a couple of questions . You do not have to answer . I shall answer what I know . I like this guy , your guy . What happens to your guy when he gets home ? Well , we have to make a determination whether our guy is now your guy . Now , as I said to you before , he 's acted honorably . He 's still your guy , believe me . Of course you will say that if it were true and if it were not true . I guess it has come down to that , huh ? Well , forgive me for pushing , but is he in any danger if the determination is made ? Well , goodness . As things are now , everyone is in danger . Cheers . Na zdorovie . There will be no exchange on Glienicke Bridge . Excuse me , sir . There will be no exchange . Not for Frederic Pryor . Mr . Vogel , I thought yesterday we had agreed . We agreed on an exchange , Abel for Pryor . Now I learn you are a rug merchant selling the same rug to two customers . Abel for Pryor you sell to us . Yeah . And Abel for Powers you sell to the Soviets . I 'm not quite sure what the problem is if the arrangement satisfies two parties or three or four . What difference does it make ? The arrangement does not satisfy this party . Now , Mr . Vogel , please ... Obviously you do not know who you are dealing with . Here 's the interest of the German Democratic Republic . To deal with , and to be seen to be dealing with another sovereign power , the United States . An equal power . Instead you treat us as stooges for the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics . Can we just call them the Russians ? It 'll save time . I have an appointment , sir . I think it 's you who are wasting time . Now , tell me if I am describing this wrong . You have a kid , a university student , someone you know is not a spy , who 's no threat to you . And in exchange for this person who is worthless to you , you play an equal part in an exchange between the Russians and the Americans . And this is one transaction between us and the two of you . We 're not trying to do two things here , sir . We 're just doing one thing . One , one , one . It 's hard for me to see how the Republic of East German Democrats is being slighted . You agreed with the Soviets without consulting me . Is this a negotiation or a conspiracy ? For it to be a conspiracy , there would have to be harm to you , sir . There 's just benefits here . We 're of agreeing interests . No , you decide they agree . Where is your appointment , sir ? In the West . Ku' damm . Good . Look around you . How does the Eastern sector compare with the West ? Hmm ? Our Russian friends have decided that we should not rebuild our capital city . But we live in this ruin made by our Russian friends . Go ahead , make your deal with these Russians . We won 't be part of it . There is no deal without Pryor . We are not leaving him here . Is this your position or your government 's ? Sir , I 'm here . I 'm talking to you . But you are not a representative of your government . You don 't know who you are . Neither do we . You should be careful . This is not Brooklyn , Mr . Donovan . Look , sir . You must know that in every respect that matters , I represent my government . You know who I am . Do I ? Uh- oh . Do you have the proper papers ? Of course not . It doesn 't matter . An American lawyer like you can talk your way out of anything . Can 't you ? You go with him . Why ? It 's passport problem . What ... What problem ? What 's the problem ? You go with him . And remember , we control the fate of Frederic Pryor . My God ! Yeah , I' ll start with some coffee , please . Then I' ll have the Hilton combo and the American breakfast . And coffee . Both breakfasts ? Yeah , yeah . One first or ... Both first , both . Whenever they 're ready . And coffee . Hmm . You shouldn 't be here . Well , sometimes in Germany , you just want a big American breakfast . What happened ? Where were you last night ? Vogel arranged for me to spend some time in the East . Oh , Jesus . Frankly , it 's not that much worse than where you have me here in the West . So the Russians are fine with the exchange , but now Vogel is saying that the East Germans won 't do it . We 're not gonna get Pryor . Great , good . So the Soviets are set . We get Powers . We get Powers . Well done . No , the East Germans won 't do it . We won 't get Pryor , and that kid matters . Every person matters . Sure , that 's why you tried . That 's why you tried . Abel 's on his way , so we 're all set for tomorrow morning . Wait a minute . Makes things simple . Makes things simple . We are not getting the kid . Yeah , I understand . We 're set . We can ignore the message we got this morning . What message ? From the East Germans . They called the number I gave you . They said they wanted to speak to you today . Vogel called ? No , um ... Office of , uh , Harald Ott , East German attorney general . Wanting what ? What does he want ? Well , to talk to you . But it 's okay , I can 't ask you to go back there . And listen , you seem to be persona non grata to some elements , so we won 't push our luck . So he wants to see me . What time ? Oh , no , no . Now , listen . You don 't need to go . In fact , you shouldn 't go . In fact , you can 't go . We 're set with the Soviets . We don 't want to screw it up . I 'm not gonna screw it up . You 're not going ! Don 't be a pain in the ass . Oh , I ordered . Enjoy your big American breakfast . I thought it should be negotiated at the highest level as a courtesy to you . I thank you , sir . I don 't know how things became so confused . Well , I guess sometimes they just do . For sake of clarity , I say we are fully prepared to exchange the so- called student , Pryor , for Rudolf Abel . I understand from Mr . Vogel that Pryor is very important to you . Yes , but ... Ah , we 'll do a memorandum to that effect . Oh , a memorandum . Certainly , we commit to a bi- lateral exchange . Yes , yes , sure . I 'm not sure what that means but ... My country also insists on Francis Gary Powers . No ! This is how things became so confused . Powers . What use is he , sir ? You want him back for punitive reasons ? What 's done is done . He has divulged what he will divulge , as no doubt Abel has also . We are offering instead someone who you insist is innocent . And this is right . This is who you should retrieve . The future . Look to the future . Ott . Ott . I 'm sorry . If you could give me a moment , sir . I 'm very sorry , sir . The attorney general regrets that he had to leave on urgent business . He left ? Yes . Many apologies . I' ve been waiting for over an hour . Very sorry , sir . Young man . Come here . It 's all right . Come here . Uh ... Take a seat . Oh , come on , come on . Sit down . Do you like your job here ? It 's a very good job , sir . It must be . Must be interesting . Oh , yes , sir . And important , too . And your English is ... Is good . Yes , I hesitate to say it 's excellent . But it 's excellent , sir . Good , good . Good . See , I just lost my negotiating partner , and I need somebody to talk to , and you seem like a reasonable young man . Can I talk to you ? Uh ... It 's all right . It 's all right . I just ... I just need you to give a message to your boss . But it has to be very , very , very clear . You understand ? Yes , sir . But perhaps you should wait until he ... No , no . The thing is , I have this cold and I wanna get home and get in bed . Can you give him the message ? Certainly . Well , this is the message . " There is no deal for Abel unless we get Powers and Pryor . " Do you understand ? Yes , sir . It 's arranged for tomorrow morning . It will not happen unless we get two men . Those two men . Two , two , two . Yes , sir . If there is no deal , your boss must tell the Soviets . He has to tell the Soviets that they are not getting Rudolf Abel . Yes , sir . Oh , and tell him this . That so far , Abel has been a good soldier , but he thinks he 's going home . If we had to tell him that he 's not going home , that the Soviets don 't even want him , that he 's never going home ... Well , I imagine his behavior might change . And who will be held responsible for that ? That 's a long message . Uh , did you get it all ? Yes , sir . Got it . Good . You 're a good man . Oh ... And also tell him there 's no deal unless we hear before the end of business today . He has the number . If the exchange isn 't gonna happen , no reason for everybody to get up first thing in the morning . No , sir , that would be pointless . You 're kidding me ! You 're kidding me ! Not really . I need some change . This is exactly what you weren 't supposed to do . My instructions were to feel out the situation . Your instructions were to get Powers , not Pryor . That was not the original deal . You fouled it all up ! How do you know ? I feel pretty good about it . You fucked it all up ! Oh , don 't worry . I think it 's gonna be fine . How do you know ? You don 't know that . United States . New York , New York . Danke . Look , this whole thing has been to feel me out . Would I swap one for one and which one ? But I said " No , two for one . " So they know where we stand . Yeah , what if they think about it and say , uh ... " Forget it ! You keep our guy , we keep your guys " ? Well , then I have fucked it all up . Hey , honey ! It 's me . Yeah . The fishing 's been great . I 'm in London , just for one more meeting , then I 'm on my way home . Yeah , yeah , I remember that marmalade . It 's that shop right by Regent 's Park . All right , I will if I have the time . Hey , can I say hi to Roger ? Could I say hi to the girls ? Is anyone not busy ? Have they even noticed I 'm not around ? We 're on . Two for one . Hot dog . Let 's have a drink . One wrinkle . What is that ? They won 't release Pryor with Powers , not at the bridge . They 'll release him at the same time . When the Russians give us Powers on the bridge , they 'll release Pryor over Checkpoint Charlie . What does that mean ? I think it means , " We wanna have the last word . " But they will do it . You tell me . You felt them out . Where are they ? Where 's our guy ? Where 's our guy ? They 're late . Nobody 's late . We 're early . May I ? Yeah . Hoffman . Yeah ? I think they have ... What ? ... snipers . Well , I 'm sure they do . How are you sure they do ? Because we have snipers . Step out , sir . Jim . Dear Jim . How are you ? Happy to see you . Have you arranged all this for me ? Well , let 's see what this is before I ... I take credit for it . Any word about Pryor from Checkpoint Charlie ? Nothing cooking yet . Excuse me , sir . This is Lieutenant Joe Murphy , United States Air Force , here to identify Powers . Lieutenant Murphy . Sir . There may be a slight glitch . I was a young man when I left . Who will they find to identify me ? Well , I hope it 's not your East German family . I doubt they could identify each other . Looks like our party . Well , let 's go . You can stay here , Donovan . Not likely . Open the gate . What do you think will happen when you get home ? Uh , I think ... I' ll have a vodka . Yeah . Yeah . But , Rudolf , is there not the possibility ... That my people are going to shoot me ? Yes . You 're not worried ? Would it help ? To answer your question , my friend , I acted honorably . I think they know that . But sometimes people think wrong . People are people . Let 's see how they greet me . What can I look for ? If I 'm embraced or just shown the back seat . Da . Take off the hat . Hey , Powers . Hey , Murph . Yeah , that 's Powers . All right , Mr . Donovan . We go now ! Hang on . Believe me , I will tell you . There 's no one here . They 're releasing another man at Checkpoint Charlie . We 're just confirming that he 's there . Now ! As per plan , if you please . Let 's go . Pryor will show up or he won 't . Let 's go . They 're waiting to see if we 'll do it without him . We just have to stand here , show them we won 't . I don 't give a shit what they want . We have our objective . Go ahead , Abel . Go ahead , sir . You can go . If it is not to plan , we go home . We exchange now or we go home ! You 're waiting for another man ? Yup . You want him , too . I want him . Doesn 't matter what he wants , sir . I 'm in charge and you are free to go . Please go . Walk across . I can wait . It 's something . I 'm not sure yet . Hang on ! Let 's go . We got him ! Uh , I , uh ... I sent you a gift , Jim . It 's a ... It 's a painting . I hope it has some meaning to you . I 'm sorry . I didn 't think to get you a gift . This is your gift . This is your gift . You okay ? Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go ! Mr . Donovan . Colonel Abel asked me to give this to you . Pardon me , sir . Were you in charge of this thing , sir ? Yeah . Well , I gotta thank you . I gotta thank somebody . I gave them nothing . I gave them nothing . It doesn 't matter . It doesn 't matter what people think . You know what you did . Welcome home . What a trip . Mmm . Mmm . You okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Did you get the marmalade ? Yes , yes . Yep . Yep . I did . As ordered . Jim . This is from Arno 's . So ? On the corner ! Well , honey , I was busy . I 'm sorry . We were so busy . Oh , for Pete 's sake . How 's Roger ? Is he home ? He 's home . Carol 's home , Peggy 's home . Everyone 's home . Mom ! Come quick ! Look ! - Mom , come here ! - Mom , come here ! - Come see this ! Look ! Watch ! - Come on ! Francis Gary Powers has been released from prison in the Soviet Union and turned over to American authorities early this morning in Berlin . The President has commuted the sentence of Rudolf Abel . Mr . Abel has been deported and has been released in Berlin . Efforts to obtain Mr . Powers´ release had been underway for some time . In recent efforts , the United States government has had the cooperation and assistance of Mr . James B . Donovan , a New York attorney . Frederic L . Pryor , an American student held by East German authorities since August of 1961 ... I thought Daddy was fishing . For salmon . Abel now has disappeared into the communist world . Powers is here , answering questions . And Donovan has gone back to his law practice . And now , here is George Fenneman , speaking for the Douglas Fir Plywood Association .
