            "Creola Katherine Johnson (née Coleman; August 26, 1918 – February 24, 2020) was an American mathematician whose calculations of orbital mechanics as a NASA employee were critical to the success of the first and subsequent U.S. crewed spaceflights.[1] During her 33-year career at NASA and its predecessor, she earned a reputation for mastering complex manual calculations and helped pioneer the use of computers to perform the tasks.\n",
            "\n",
            "Early life\n",
            "Katherine Johnson was born as Creola Katherine Coleman on August 26, 1918, in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, to Joylette Roberta (née Lowe) and Joshua McKinley Coleman.[5][6][7][8] She was the youngest of four children.[9] Her mother was a teacher and her father was a lumberman, farmer, and handyman, and worked at the Greenbrier Hotel.[6][10]\n",

            "After graduating from high school at 14, Johnson enrolled at West Virginia State, a historically black college.[14] As a student, she took every math course offered by the college. Multiple professors mentored her, including the chemist and mathematician Angie Turner King, who had mentored Coleman throughout high school, and W. W. Schieffelin Claytor, the third African-American to receive a Ph.D. in mathematics. Claytor added new mathematics courses just for Johnson.[15] She graduated summa cum laude in 1937, with degrees in mathematics and French, at age 18.[16][12][17] \n",
            "\n",
            "In 1939, after marrying her first husband, James Goble, she left her teaching job and enrolled in a graduate math program. She quit one year later after becoming pregnant and chose to focus on her family life.[14] She was the first African-American woman to attend graduate school at West Virginia University in Morgantown, West Virginia. Through WVSC's president, Dr. John W. Davis, she became one of three African-American students,[14] and the only woman, selected to integrate the graduate school after the 1938 United States Supreme Court ruling Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada. \n",

            "\n",
            "Johnson decided on a career as a research mathematician, although this was a difficult field for African Americans and women to enter. The first jobs she found were in teaching. At a family gathering in 1952, a relative mentioned that the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) was hiring mathematicians.[14] At the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, based in Hampton, Virginia, near Langley Field, NACA hired African-American mathematicians as well as whites for their Guidance and Navigation Department. Johnson accepted a job offer from the agency in June 1953.[6]\n",
            "\n",
            "From 1953 to 1958, Johnson worked as a computer,[21] analyzing topics such as gust alleviation for aircraft. Originally assigned to the West Area Computers section supervised by mathematician Dorothy Vaughan, Johnson was reassigned to the Guidance and Control Division of Langley's Flight Research Division. It was staffed by white male engineers.[22] In keeping with state racial segregation laws, and federal workplace segregation introduced under President Woodrow Wilson in the early 20th century, Johnson and the other African-American women in the computing pool were required to work, eat, and use restrooms that were separate from those of their white peers. Their office was labeled as \"Colored Computers\". In an interview with WHRO-TV, Johnson stated that she \"I didn't feel any segregation. I knew it was there, but I didn't feel it.\"[23]\n",
            "\n",
            "NACA disbanded the colored computing pool in 1958 when the agency was superseded by NASA, which adopted digital computers. Although the installation was desegregated,[22] forms of discrimination were still pervasive. \n",
            "\n",
            "From 1958 until her retirement in 1986, Johnson worked as an aerospace technologist, moving during her career to the Spacecraft Controls Branch. She calculated the trajectory for the May 5, 1961 space flight of Alan Shepard, the first American in space.[1] She also calculated the launch window for his 1961 Mercury mission.[25] She plotted backup navigation charts for astronauts in case of electronic failures.[6] When NASA used electronic computers for the first time to calculate John Glenn's orbit around Earth, officials called on Johnson to verify the computer's numbers; Glenn had asked for her specifically and had refused to fly unless Johnson verified the calculations.[1][26][27] Biography.com states these were \"far more difficult calculations, to account for the gravitational pulls of celestial bodies\".[28] Author Margot Lee Shetterly stated, \"So the astronaut who became a hero, looked to this black woman in the still-segregated South at the time as one of the key parts of making sure his mission would be a success.\" She added that, in a time where computing was \"women's work\" and engineering was left to men, \"it really does have to do with us over the course of time sort of not valuing that work that was done by women, however necessary, as much as we might. And it has taken history to get a perspective on that.\"[29]\n",
            "\n",
            "Johnson later worked directly with digital computers. Her ability and reputation for accuracy helped to establish confidence in the new technology.[28] On May 5, 1961, her work helped to ensure that Alan Shepard's Freedom 7 Mercury capsule would be found quickly after landing, using the accurate trajectory that had been established.[30]\n",
            "\n",
            "She also helped to calculate the trajectory for the 1969 Apollo 11 flight to the Moon.[1][28] On 20 July 1969 during the Moon landing, Johnson was at a meeting in the Pocono Mountains. She and a few others crowded around a small television screen watching the first steps on the Moon.[1] In 1970, Johnson worked on the Apollo 13 Moon mission. When the mission was aborted, her work on backup procedures and charts helped set a safe path for the crew's return to Earth,[28] creating a one-star observation system that would allow astronauts to determine their location with accuracy. In a 2010 interview, Johnson recalled, \"Everybody was concerned about them getting there. We were concerned about them getting back.\"[30] Later in her career, Johnson worked on the Space Shuttle program, the Earth Resources Satellite,[1][28] and on plans for a mission to Mars.[31]\n",
            "\n",
            "Johnson spent her later years encouraging students to enter the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).[32]\n",

James died of an inoperable brain tumor in 1956[33] and, three years later, Katherine married James A. Johnson. the pair were married for 60 years until his death in March 2019 at the age of 93.[5][34][35]\n",

July 20, 1992). If the unseen texts contain other expression patterns such as \"July-20-1992\", my regex could not track such expressions. In the short given text (KatherineJohnson), it is possible to screen as many date expression patterns as possible manually. In much longer texts, manual effort required would be intensive, even impossible. Therefore, this kind of manual rule-based system could miss date expression patterns if the unseen texts contain wider range of expressions. In such cases, precision score will be lower for unseen texts."

        "1. Discuss the list of matching events found. \n",
        "\n",
        "The list of matching events showed that only dates in the sentences which contains only one date expression can be found as matching. In case one sentence contains multiple date expressions, though one or more of the dates in both text match, they could not be found as matching events. For example, the sentence in MaryJackson.txt \"Mary Jackson (née Winston;[1] April 9, 1921 – February 11, 2005) was an American mathematician and aerospace engineer at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), which in 1958 was succeeded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).\" contains multiple time expressions \"1921\", \"2005\" and \"1958\", and the sentence in KatherineJohnson.txt \"From 1953 to 1958, Johnson worked as a computer,[21] analyzing topics such as gust alleviation for aircraft.\" contains multiple time expressions \"1953\" and \"1958\". The matching time is 1958, however,  the time expression \"1958\" could not be found as matching event. \n",
        "\n",
        "Meanwhile, some sentences which contain only one time expression such as in MaryJackson.txt: \"In 1953, she accepted an offer to work for engineer Kazimierz Czarnecki in the Supersonic Pressure Tunnel.\"\n",
        " and in KatherineJohnson.txt: \"The family lived in Newport News, Virginia, from 1953.\" The time \"1953\" could be found as matching events. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. When going through the texts manually, some matching events could not be found programmatically/automatically?\n",
        "\n",
        "Yes, as mentioned above, some dates contained in the sentences which hold multiple time expressions could not be found as matching events, though the dates are the same between the two.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. If so, what could be the reason(s) for this? \n",
        "\n",
        "The mechanism of finding matching events is that, the pandas library looks for the cells which contain the same values and join the two dataframes into new one which contains matching values (the same time expressions). For example, in a timeline dataframe, one cell contains expression \"1958\", the cell of the other dataframe contains also \"1958\". They are string values. The built-in function considers them as the same string values, so those expressions could be interpreted as matching. However, in some cases, for instance, in KatherineJohnson text, \"From 1953 to 1958, Johnson worked as a ...\" contains multiple dates such as \"1953\" and \"1958\", and in MaryJackson text, \"she was promoted to aerospace engineer in 1958\" contains \"1958\" as date expressions, however, 1958 could not be found as matching events here, because right from the start, I could not manage to extract the second expression \"1958\" into the timeline from the sentence holding multiple date expressions, only \"1953\" was extracted only. Since the date is missing in the timeline dataframe, the system could not track them. \n",
        "\n",
        "This issue is also the difficulty I encountered. I have difficulty in writing up the code/regex which can compile all date expressions from the sentences which hold multiple time expressions. If I try to extract all dates from the sentences containing multiple time expressions, it would be impossible to create a timeline in a dataframe due to different data shapes."
